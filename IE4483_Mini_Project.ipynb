       "57    These are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff Levi's. My cutoffs are so faded, so frayed, so, well you know. So when I peal them off to reveal this Butterfly Lace up Panty (in Black with the pick laces on the back) it's like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl. We only had two colors at our lingerie party, white and the black and pink models, but I can imagine all the colors would be nice too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "1807  Although I personally prefer the (now-discontinued) Jefferson and Washington models from Dockers (which were very similar to these Rockports in design and style but more comfortable) I'll admit that these are excellent. They have a simultaneously casual and dress-casual styling and aura and go well with both khaki pants and jeans.  As with most Rockport shoes the overall quality of both craftsmanship and built is excellent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
