At night, I wash them before I go to bed, and leave them on the domes to dry over night (using the washables at night).  Despite following the instructions on Lily Padz maintenance very carefully, I feel they've lost their tackiness, and I worry about their effectiveness.  So far, no big problems, but I'd feel more secure if they did not appear to have started to wear out already.

The bag is huge and it is well separated so you can divide your things exceptionally well.   It can be wheeled, carried (with top handles) or hefted on your back.   I put the bag heavily loaded on my back and carried it for about 3 blocks in Cusco.   While it wasn't the most comfortable carry - it allowed me to move faster and more easily.   \\nThe one thing I was concerned with the older bag were the zippers.   At one point the teeth were not meshing on either the top or bottom sections and I was worried they were ruined.   But I simply ran both the zippers to the same end (using small force) and the teeth seemed to be fixed.

The only complaint is that the ID window that you could pull out out from the back pocket and then have it \"pop\" back doesn't do that anymore. Instead of a elastic band that attached the window to the wallet, Mundi substituted a plastic fastner..like the kind that stores use to hang price tags on clothes.

The variability on sizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order. You really have to try them on to see how they fit. The 501 are much easier to buy online or by mail order because the sizing is much less critical on the waist, which is the so-called \"anti-fit\" waist, meaning there is no curve to the rise (the distance between the crotch and the top of the waist), because the original 501s were merely cut down bib overalls which were made to hang, rather than be fitted to the waist. The biggest problem I have noted on the 505's is the variability in size in the thigh area, meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight, even though they are theoretically the same size of a label. Since the 501s are more forgiving as far as sizing, if you are buying online you might consider them instead of 505s, unless you don't want the button fly.</td>\n",

It looks just like cotton and has a matte finish - it's not shiny/silky like the Loose Gear shirts or Heat Gear compression shirts. It is very soft, comfortable and lightweight, and I love this shirt both for working out and casual wear. The shirt runs true to size (buy your regular T-shirt size and it will fit really well), and is the roomiest cut of the Under Armour shirts. I absolutely LOVE the raglan sleeves on the tech tee - one of the features that makes them so comfortable and gives them a little bit of a unique look.\\n\\nThe tech tee has a small amount of a lycra-like fabric in with the polyester microfiber, which gives it quite a bit of stretch. I like this because the shirt doesn't bind if you're doing something that really requires you to reach or stretch - certain weight exercises, aerobics, yoga, etc. The shirt works the way it's supposed to, and wicks moisture from your skin for rapid evaporation.\\n\\nThe tech tee is available in numerous colors (I have 6 of them) and in spite of the fact that the fabric is thin and lightweight, the shirts are very opaque. The shirts have a nice cut and look great over jeans or shorts - in addition to the gym, I often wear them out and around, or when working in the yard. They are super comfortable worn as an undershirt too, but are probably a little costly for that. Like all the Under Armour shirts, they have a self-material neck band, but it fits just right and says in place, even if you get sweaty - it doesn't sag like the cotton ones.\\n\\nWhile I have zero complaints about the tech tee, be aware that it is Under Armour's \"budget\" product, if there is such a thing. The material does start to pill after a few washings - this affects appearance slightly, but not performance or fit. Although I haven't worn out ANY of my Under Armour shirts yet, I'm going to venture that the tech t-shirt won't be quite as durable as their signature Loose Gear shirts and Heat Gear compression shirts, nor does it perform quite as well. On the other hand it, it's about 20% cheaper, so as with anything else, you get what you pay for.\\n\\nWhen stacked up against UA's other shirts, I'd say the tech tee is for you if:\\n\\n1) You like the look and feel of a soft, cotton t-shirt but want the wicking and performance of a microfiber shirt.\\n\\n2) You don't care for the shiny, silky, more synthetic look and feel of the Loose Gear shirts, or the tightness of the Heatgear compression shirt.\\n\\n3) You want a shirt that's a little roomier.\\n\\n4) You want a shirt with stretch in it.\\n\\n5) You want to save a little $$ but still wear an authentic UA logo shirt</td>\n",

It is sheer on the bottom, so you will need a slip underneath.  The beading is nice (extra beads are included) and the way the dress flares out at the bottom is very unique.  The dress was long on me, and would probably need to be taken in at least 3 inches.  The clasp are loosely sewn on (two broke after I took off the dress), so I would have a seamstress sew it on more tightly.

I was tired of having mismatched tags that I had scraped up from anywhere and everywhere. I was also looking for a tag that kept my personal information covered up from strangers standing nearby. Another thing I was looking for was a tag that was strong. It was not uncommon for me to pick up my luggage in the airport to discover my tag had been ripped off. Sometimes part of it was left. Sometimes all of it was gone. Luggage and their tags take a lot of abuse.\\n\\nOK about this product...They are real leather. They are nice looking. There are two reasons why I am giving this product a 4 instead of a 5 rating. First the leather is a little on the thin side. It would be a nice thickness to make a ladies purse or a fine wallet for a businessman in a suit but...a luggage tag? Like I said, these tags need to be virtually indestructable to survive. I am a little dubious that the thin leather strap will really hold up. I may be wrong...this is only my speculation at this point. The second thing is the price. It seems to me that this product should be in the 3 to 4 dollar, each, price range instead of the 5 to 6 dollar range.\\n\\nThere are different colors available which is good (I bought green) because nowadays 95% of all the bags coming down the conveyor are BLACK. Everyone needs something on the outside of their bag to help make it easily identifiable. These colored tags do that</td>\n",

       "      <td>I recently purchased a small AmeriBag Healthy Back Bag in anticipation of a long summer trek through Europe.  I didn't think my backpack would be secure from pickpocketers, and I wanted something a little more \"grown up.\"  Here are some reasons I am very happy with this purchase:\\n\\n1) Comfort.  My Healthy Back Bag is more comfortable than either a backpack or a large purse.  Its wide strap sets securely on my shoulder without a hand on it, and it adjusts easily so I can carry it across my chest.  You can put a lot in it and not feel the weight - you will not end up with your shoulder in knots at the end of the day.\\n\\n2) Security.  The zippered compartment openings fit neatly beneath my armpit; there are interior zipper pockets as well, so it's pretty hard to imagine someone's hand slipping into the bag without my knowing it.  The wide strap is reinforced so it would be hard to cut.\\n\\n3) Convenience.  This bag has supremely well-designed features.  On the outside, there is a flat zipper pocket (good for your subway pass) and a separate velcro pocket on one side, a velcro pocket with a flap on the other, and a small pocket suitable for (say) sunglass on the end. The main zipped compartment has a wide variety of open pockets (for perhaps a pen, a camera, a PDA or Ipod), including one conveniently placed sidways so you can easily get at it from when it's still on your shoulder.  That one is perfect for a cellphone.  There is a flat inside zipper pocket that serves me well as a wallet.\\n\\n4) Capacity.  I've got the small version of the bag, and it will still hold a wide variety of daily essentials: wallet, phone, camera, ipod, a paperback, a compact umbrella, and even perhaps a very light sweater.\\n\\nThe biggest problem with these bags is figuring out which one you want - err on the small side (they are more comfortable), then choose whatever fabric and color suits your fancy.  You can even get them in a premium leather, but my microfibre one seems easy to clean and a good value.\\n\\nThis is my favorite bag - I can easily see several decades in my future with a Healthy Back Bag under my arm.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Well, after using my Creative Zen naked, with no covering at all; with the other popular leather cover; and with this sillicon cover/package, I can honestly say that, considering the price and what's included in this package, this is, by far, the best route to go when picking a case for your own Zen. \\n\\nThe other main case, the leather one, looks nice, but for around $30, I expect a little more functionality. This cover is a few dollars cheaper, and for that, I would only expect a cover, as is included with the leather one. But, when you take into account the screen protector that's included (and which costs $15 by itself from other places), the stand on the back (which is, granted, mildly weak, but look at what it's holding up....if you watch your share of videos and movies on your Zen, as I do, the back-stand comes in very handy), and the other things, I would expect it to be more. So, don't let the cheap price deter you from getting this one, as it almost did me, thinking that it's poor quality. The sillicon tends to attract dust and lint, but it wipes or blows away easily, and is, really, the only thing that comes close to a downside. \\n\\nGet this case. You won't regret it</td>\n",

The outer shell by itself provides some warmth and also the water resistant outside to put over something else, say for example the suit jacket I wore to work. Definately not for winter use by itself but a nice compliment to something else. The fleece on its own is what I liked.

       "      <td>I was fortunate to be able to pick up the Chocolate Lab striped Oxford when it was offered in the winter.  There's nothing plain about this Oxford.  I would say classic because of the clean lines and gentle shaping provided by the darts in the back.  An additional benefit generally about all of Bealls' long-sleeve Oxfords is that they are shorter in length than most traditional Oxfords.  Most Oxford shirts are about 27\"-28\" in length in a Misses size (0-20), but Bealls' tend to run about 25\"-26\" depending on your size for proportion.  The advantage is that you do not feel the need to tuck, but you can still tuck if you would like.  Personally, I have never been a fan of tucking shirts into pants or skirts, especially if you want to highlight either.\\n\\nWhoever sews these garments takes great care.  The back darts are aligned perfectly and the button thread is done criss-cross style with a double looping underneath for extra strength.  The actual striping of the shirt is straight.  I've seen with some more expensive shirts where someone either didn't follow the pattern correctly or tried to correct an improper pattern badly.  To me, that makes a tremendous difference whether I will come back for more.\\n\\nI am looking forward to more colors again.  The Chocolate Lab stripe is the only one I own and I've had many ask me where I purchased.  I would love to see all of the colors which are offered in the 3/4 sleeve version with the addition of a Kelly green, Gatsby Yellow (short-sleeve version color) and perhaps even a beautiful Violet.\\n\\nDefinitely try this shirt because I know you will be pleased</td>\n",

This jean is the \"slim\" version of classic Cowboy Cut jean that Wrangler has been making since 1947. Among the Levi's jeans, the fit of this jeans is most similar to that of the Levi's 512,but it is cut slimmer in the seat. It doesn't have as much orange stitching as a Levi's, the back pockets sit higher. It has a zipper fly. The so-called \"rigid denim\" looks a lot like the \"shrink to fit\" rigid denim of the Levi's button fly 501 when new and will lose a lot of indigo dye on the first wash, but that's where the resemblance ends. The 501 shrinks about 10%, but the Wrangler shrinks less than 3%, because it is Sanforized. So, you should buy your correct size, erring on the side of slightly larger if you are right on the border.  \\n\\nCompared to the regular the Wrangler Cowboy Cut, the this slim Fit is quite a bit skimpier. The slim fit seat is smaller and the legs are pretty trim--it's more of a boy's cut. If you are really on the thin side, it may work for you, but many men will find it too constricting in the waist and seat. \\n\\nWranglers stonewash finishes are pretty mainstream compared to some of the more exotic things Levi's is doing now.

The fit was perfect, PacificPlex's sizes are right on, and their sizing chart really helped so check that out before you buy. The dress in very well made and included straps that could be sewn on should one choose too. My daughter felt like a princess and my friend ordered the burgundy version for her daughters graduation.

The swim style is cut very low in front, with a fairly small pouch.  Not only is it great for working out under your workout pants or shorts, it actually turns out to be a very sexy pair of underwear for everyday or play.  The low rise cut pairs very well with low rise jeans, not to mention the barely there skimpy factor.  Heat it up a little and try this jock under your low cut jeans.....looks and feels hot!

       "      <td>Be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards.  I bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards, my ID and some cash.  Hence, there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet.  From the picture, it looks as though the business card side is just a slot. Whereas, in reality, it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders).  Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space), the leather itself is very low quality, and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it.  Furthermore, on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China.  I mean, China is great and all but if you're on a date and you say \"Hey, let me pay for this,\" and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China, well, you are pretty much a schmuck (I cut mine out with a pair of scissors, but there are still some remnants).  So if you like being low class, by all means, buy this wallet.  I personally don't care about my wallet very much so I am keeping it and going to use it, but I almost returned it.  It is most definitely a solid 2 stars.  Hope this helps</td>\n",

       "10    Well, I recieved this product as it was one of the only cases made for the Video Ipod when I got mine.  As soon as i got it, I put it on.... it was a bit difficult at first, but once in there snug, i have never taken it out.  About... 2 days later, my IPod fell out of my jacket pocket and tumbled hard down a flight of CONCRETE stairs.  I was sure that it was damaged... but, I opened the case, turned it on, and and was fine.... I was quite relieved.  That alone justifies the price of the case. I am proud to say that it is still in there to this day, and the only thing I could have asked for would have been a somewhat tighter fit around the clickwheel, as there is a bit of space for dirt/dust to get into.  That and the whole made for the headphones could be a tad bigger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "11    I'm female, but only buy the men's versions of pants. This is only partly because of how comfortable they are (loose fit means loose with men's stuff, which is what I prefer). I bought this chromium gray pair from M A C Y * S directly, but they weren't any cheaper. I have 2 other pairs of the same pants in khaki and black (also not from A m a z o n).\\n\\nThese pants are true cargo with the side leg pockets, the flaps on the rear pockets (carpenter pants don't have the closeable flap on back, but still have at least one side pocket). The material is soft cotton. I feel like I'm wearing a pair of pajamas when I wear these and I love that. The pants wrinkle easily, but that's the price you pay for sheer comfort. And the Levi's brand should mean they last \"forever\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "28    I'm very particular about the feel of a material, especially my sleepwear, and this product if perfect. Its very comfortable, and the material is breathable which is what I like. I do however think that the length could've been a little shorter, but that's a choice thing I guess                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "30    As a breastfeeding mother, it's important to me that I keep my bras dry and leak-free (not to mention my clothes).  I've been using my Lily Padz since my daughter (now nearly 4 weeks old) was a few days old.  (We had latch-on problems initially, so I used washable pads until my nipples healed.)  I really like this product.  It's smooth under clothing, and it clings pretty reliably.  It isn't perfect, but it doesn't claim to be.  When I have a gushing let-down, nothing will contain it, not Lily Padz nor cloth breast pads.  That's a little disappointing, but I suppose it's to be expected.  I only wish that the tackiness held up a little better.  I have tended lovingly to my Lily Padz, following instructions on washing and drying and what not.  In fact, I only wear them during the day.  At night, I wash them before I go to bed, and leave them on the domes to dry over night (using the washables at night).  Despite following the instructions on Lily Padz maintenance very carefully, I feel they've lost their tackiness, and I worry about their effectiveness.  So far, no big problems, but I'd feel more secure if they did not appear to have started to wear out already.  Still - they're totally worth the investment, and I may just buy another pair, so I can alternate and keep wear to a minimum                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "41    Our 6-year old wants to be a policeman when he grows up. He could not wait to get this belt. We had purchased the police uniform earlier. The first time I ordered the belt, it got lost in the mail so he had to wait almost a month to get it. When it finally arrived, he could have wrapped it around his waist 3 times it was so long. It is made of very thin vinyl and does not hold up very well to having holes punched in it.

       "57    These are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff Levi's. My cutoffs are so faded, so frayed, so, well you know. So when I peal them off to reveal this Butterfly Lace up Panty (in Black with the pick laces on the back) it's like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl.

       "62    This set of underwear is fantastic. I've always had a taste for boxer briefs, but this set is better than all the others I have ever worn. They move perfectly with you and the fabric enlarges my 'bulge' excellently. My only complaint is a tendency for the legs to ride up a bit. But that's a minor complaint for a majorly attractive piece of underwear                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "67    I like the style, it fits in the back, and the waist band fits well, but the pouch is a bit small. Because of the seam down the middle, I thought it would have more of a pouch                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "75    this product never made it to destination. it was purchased with pants to match(which were pin-striped and didn't) and it was never sent to the recipient, nor was i invoiced, so i am currious if the seller plans to at this point, or even if they intend to send the correct pants??? all i know is that with everything else being late for shipping durring the holiday, and the wrong products otherwise, i will not purchase from this seller again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "78    I purchased last years model of the AT202 (not as pretty, but the same functionally) and took it on my trip to Peru for 4 weeks.   The bag is huge and it is well separated so you can divide your things exceptionally well.   It can be wheeled, carried (with top handles) or hefted on your back.   I put the bag heavily loaded on my back and carried it for about 3 blocks in Cusco.   While it wasn't the most comfortable carry - it allowed me to move faster and more easily.   \\nThe one thing I was concerned with the older bag were the zippers.   At one point the teeth were not meshing on either the top or bottom sections and I was worried they were ruined.   But I simply ran both the zippers to the same end (using small force) and the teeth seemed to be fixed.   I really love this bag and will use it often for all my travels, so the potential zipper problem is the only thing I can mention.

       "79    I wanted a travel kit that does not weigh much because the person I wanted to give it to travels a lot on carry-on baggage. I was very happy with the purchase.

       "83    I received a maroon one as a gift and have gotten endless complements on it. When I walked into a knitting shop, the owner thought I had made it until she looked closely at it's edge. I wish I could knit one like it! I tried to knit one and couldn't get it to have the resiliency. It becomes a long tube scarf, or a becoming hat-capelet. \\nIt's fluffy yet warm though light, even though it isn't wool.

       "97    I love this bag. I bought it to organize all of my toiletries for any given day either at a cramped gym or on the road. The unique design allows me to pack all of my travel bottles into the slots so that they stay in place and remain upright. The other compartments are easy to access and thoughtfully placed. The bag is easy for me to hang in the locker room shower for quick and sanitary use. The hook can be rotated so once I am out of the shower, I can hang the bag facing the other direction to conveniently access my cosmetics. The handles on this bag are very sturdy and all you to carry everything with one hand even when the pockets are unzipped. This is also great in the gym. I have quite a few products I like to use in the course of a day and this bag hold it all with room to spare. Like I said, I love this bag                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "98    I bought this for a woman who is a small size eight, one of those people who is just a touch too big to wear a size six, and normal medium sized clothes usually run very loose.  Not this tiny shirt. It looked all right when she opened the package, but when she wore it, it made the kid look as if she had flub.  It was inexpensive enough that I won't bother returning it, but the item, although well made, was sized so small as to be useles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "104   The item is much better than any others that I have got through out the years. It should last a long time. Not rip easy. It feels very sturdy.

       "122   I've tried many different jocks out there, and always find the pouches to run really small and doesn't provide much breathing room for my package. I usually end up feeling smashed and confined. What I like about this jock is there is a little stretch to the pouch, so once I put my package in the pouch, I'm able to pull on the material and create more room. I would still prefer a little more room in the pouch, but it is better than most. What is great, are the straps. I like the way they wrap around your cheeks, rather than strap across. What I did not like was the rubber Jocko tag on the front side. I think it kind of cheapens the look                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "127   The slippers were of very good quality and Lands End shipped them to me very quickly.  I have only two very minor concerns.  One is that the soles of the slippers were a little thinner/more flexible than I would have liked.  The other is that the slippers don't come in 1/2 sizes.  I normally wear an 8 1/2 shoe and with this type of slipper I usually buy a size 8.  Because the sole curved up over the front, I found the slipper to be a bit short.  However, I know that the 9 would have been way too big.  Over time, the slipper did stretch a bit so it is more comfortable now than it was when new                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "142   I was pleased with all purchase.  I did not feel that I was given enough consideration on shipping costs as a very old and loyal customer.  In addition for reasons that are not clear to me, I continue to get duplicate orders, or the order is sent to an old address.  The return process in this circumstance is cumbersome and communicating with you and receiving a cogent response is quite difficul                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "146   Whoever shot the photos for this bag did a great job - the bag was not as nice as it looked in the photos.  It also did not fit the oversized laptop that it seemed it would.  The wheels didn't seem like they would take much abuse, and the organizer pockets were cheap plastic.  It earns points for color selection and for the handle.  All in all, I sent it back despite the fact that the eBag policy is to only give a partial refund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "149   C'mon now...those of you who are making fun of the \"fad\" and are simultaneously jumping on that same bandwagon by buying this piece of the \"fad\" and paying triple for something that really is pure profit should look up the word \"irony\" in the dictionary.\\n\\nI agree that people should give directly to charities, but if impulse purchases at the checkout counter and the web lead to more money going toward charities from people who wouldn't normally directly donate, I'm all for it. It's called taking advantage of people's desire to be part of something and using it for some good.

       "150   This is a really handy little gadget to carry around--it fits in your suitcase's pocket and works quite well. The only drawback is that the tape measure part slides out and exposes the metal inner workings. I was able to get it back together without injury, but those tape measures are sharp! I put some electric tape around the sides to keep this from happening again.

Overall, a bad buy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "166   I have returned the shirt from amazon/macys. I did not like it and I am still waiting for my refund. I purchased it in January. Where's my refund. I will not buy from companies that don't offer free shipping. I was charged to recieve it and also to ship it back.\\n\\n                             Ms. Michelle Watso                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "169   I bought this dress for my daughter's wedding.  I looked all around the local market and was not pleased with my choices.  I figured that I didn't have anything to lose looking on the internet.  Well I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and fit.  The price wasn't bad either and I even had the option of returning it if it didn't work, something you don't have with a bridal shop.  It is perfect , doesn't need any alterations only pressing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "180   Best of the ones I've tried.  Outside seams cause less irritation to the hand and the gloves offer firm support to both the hand and the fingers.  Don't be afraid to purchase if you need the support for only one hand.  The special way the gloves are seamed means that both gloves can be used for just one hand, as in carpal tunnel syndrome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "186   When I received my purse, there was a small black smudge on the front of it.  I sent a note to NVie Designs to see if it could be exchanged.  They promptly replied with a return address to exchange the purse.  Well, I was shocked to see my replacement purse in the mail before they had received my return!  The purse is beautiful and I've received many compliments on it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

The dress looks very stylish and can be accesorized so it can be \"dressed up\" or \"down.\"  On a cooler day, you may want to wear a turtleck and hosiery with it.  It is kind of short, so wearers should keep that it mind.  Overall, it is a nice-looking, good-value dress                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "195   These are the best!!! When they say skinny-they mean it.  I cannot find any jeans that will fit this tall skinny child, and not look to baggy.(which she hates) We still needed the adjustable waist(believe it or not) But the difference was the slim cut through the hinnie and hips-she looks like a regular little girl, instead of a skinny girl with pants that are way to big                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "197   I was skeptical at first to buy this item because it seemed like too much money to spend on a simple elastic band with velcro, but as my baby got bigger, my back & hips got progressivly weaker to the point that I couldn't even stand for five minutes without being in horrific pain and feeling like I was about to collapse.  I decided to finally break down and spend the money on this belt and let me tell you, I ONLY WISH I'D GOTTEN IT SOONER!!! Like before I had the previous three kids!  :^)\\n    I'm not sure what happened with the person who wrote a bad review, talking about the band putting too much pressure on the hips...I can only assume that either she got the wrong size or was using it incorrectly.  I have found that I can't tolerate sitting for extended periods with the belt tight, my legs go numb, so I usually just take it off when I'm resting at home for the night.  But my days always start with this band and I can get SO much more done now                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "204   I own about 5 pairs of these, they are super comfy and feel like you are wearing nothing at all in the back (no rididng or wedgies here) with good support at the front.  The fabric allows you to wear them low or high depending on how you feel most comfortable and there is enough fabric at the top so you dont end up with butt floss showing when you bend or sit down.  Dont just order one pair order a weeks worth you wont regret i                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "208   I really love the shorts (I own 5 pair) but the thing I hate is that there is no key pocket inside.  No big deal really, I just tuck it somewhere else like in my shoe, but the little pockets are nice.  Otherwise these shorts are awesome and allow for full leg movement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "219   When I received the robe set it was even prettier in person than on the screen.  I wear it every nite.  I am a breast cancer survivor and when I wear this I feel sexier than ever.  It is so comfortable also.  If anyone is thinking about it, I wouldn't even hesitate.  It washes fantastically.  I may even get it in another color                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "224   The top was very roughly finished. The end of the blue part that crosses the chest did not stay in place,because the seams on it were very rough, so I had to take the whole part out because it made the top look more crooked than it is supossed to be. The top got COMPLETELY ruined on the first wash, I followed the instructions to a \"T\" during washing but still the blue on the top ran and I had to throw it away. The skirt is still fine after washing it twice but I would not recommend this outfit to anybody                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "244   i ordered a plain white puma shirt with a lime puma design, instead i got a white puma shirt with black design and lime collar (the shirt was ugly, why would they even design something like that). it was the second time in a row i was burned trying to order this shirt that i want. and it sucks because you have to pay shipping twice to return it! but i double checked the shirt i was ordering before i ordered and i stil get sent the wrong shirt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

It's lighter than the previous version but that also means it's thinner so it can be a cit cold for winter running but I just wear two pairs of socks and look forward to being cool in the summer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "252   This camo t-shirt was exactly as represented. The only reason for the lack of a 5th star is because I thought that they should have listed in the description that the shirt runs small so order big, or to let us know it was sized for Juniors.  Thank goodness I ordered XLARGE!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "261   The extra panel makes these the greatest for those of us amply endowed. It is so nice to not have the seams in the back and crotch rip out before the rest of the nylon is hardly worn.  I only gave it a 4 star review because little pulls do come fairly soon. I think I will try the full support ones and maybe this won't be an issue.  Thanks for a great and much needed product                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "272   Just got my hip scarf in the mail today. It is very pretty,  I love the way the coins  sounds.  Tho , the scarf looks cheaply  made , ( what do expect for  only  9.99 )  It is a bargin . Most scarfs are 30 dollars are more.  I think it should be okay if you keep it in good shape. I just started belly dancing , having the scarf makes it even more fun                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "274   If you are wanting a garment that will cinch you down a few sizes this is NOT for you.  If you are looking for something that will smooth you out under your clothes and not make you sweat all day this is the PERFECT item for you.\\n\\nIt does not roll down - even after wearing it all day.\\n\\nYou do not get overheated in it.\\n\\nI love it to hold that flabby skin tight.  After having kids my stomach moves with each step and its very uncomfortable.  Lipo in a box keeps me all together.

       "279   I hate thongs.  DESPISE them.  Would much rather go commando.  I read once in a medical publication that physicians warn against g-strings and thongs that wedge themselves in you-know-where because the fabric acts as a wick for bacteria to migrate forward.  (Try not to vomit.)  Well, I'm one of those people who can't get a picture like that out of her mind once it, er, wedges itself in there, so I was about as anti-thong as a person could be.  But sometimes you can't (or don't dare) go commando.  In that case, a thong is mandatory.  What to do??  A salesperson sold me on the Hanky Panky thong, and I'm thrilled to say that she didn't misguide me.  The fit is loose (I know, a loose thong?--but that's the best way I can describe it) so the fabric skims the outside of your body and doesn't wedge itself in.  They're the ONLY comfortable thong I've ever worn.  So: comfy fit, no bacteria wicking -- you can't do better than that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "281   I was supposed to get it by no later than March 2, It is now March 19 and still no bag! I had read another review that said they waited a long time for this item, but I figured since I ordered it Febuary 15, to be sure it would be by now!

       "286   I was looking for a silicon skin with a hard plastic screen cover. Most other skins use the thin film protector. This one has hard plastic over the silicon skin.

I ordered 2 bras and was amazed to receive them within 3 business days.  I was very pleased with the softness and quality of the bra.  The overall fit was true to size and the support was also good.

       "295   My 7 year old daughter can operate the player, so it is very intuitive.  The screen is clear and very visable.  I have found a limitation with the included s/w that makes playback from some MPEG formats virtually unviewable.  For long movie files, the s/w splits up the file into a number of files and only the first play back correctly.  All the subsequent files run in slow motion (or a very slow frame rate).  They have told me they will send me updated s/w a number of weeks ago and I am still waiting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "314   I bought 4 pink and white totes as bridesmaids gifts. I love the price of the totes but hated the shipping cost since it was about the same. I got the bags monogram and I am very happy with how they came out. I can't wait to give the gifts to the girls!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "332   i got and love it. however, someone else's product was shipped inside the box. it looked like the box came open and someone just grabbed whatever they thought came in the box. the product was not mine and the owners name and phone and address on it. I contacted them and sent it to them myself. it was suppliments for a very serioulsy ill small boy. I hope all that get things for others send it to them too! you never know whose life depends on it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "334   The Mantra short by Prana is my favorite short for yoga.  I practice Ashtanga, which is a very active form of yoga, so my body is twisting and turning a lot.  The Mantra short is a great length - not too short, but not too long.  It fits my leg well, too - it hugs it without being too ungodly tight.  I recommend it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "335   I have been trying to find something like this but everything I tried just wasn't very bright.  But the StickUp bulb is actually bright.  About 10 times brighter than those little discs from Sylvania.\\n\\nNow if they could just make one that looks a little fancier.

       "336   I bought this bag for special occaisions, but I'm noticing ladies carrying these types of glitzy bags out to restaurants and bars.  It's a great color... chocoloate brown, which is a hard color to find in a nice dressy bag.  My sisters are fighting over who gets to borrow it!

       "353   I gave it 1 more star than hot swimmer because I consider the pilling to be very minor.  I have washed my shirt every week for a year and the pilling is barely noticeable. After a year the shirt looks great, I bought more because I have been a dull guy wearing the same black shirt every time I go to the gym.\\n\\nOh yeah, a major reason for selecting this shirt is it hangs loose around the waist.  This is good because paunches are not emphasized.  The competition's shirts(Nike)  allow you to show off your \"cut\" abs, I don't have any, so this is a good shirt for me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "354   I purchased this set for my husband. It is very nice looking, and we are happy with it.  On the downside, the arms on the sweatshirt are on the short side (he is 6'1\",has to push the sleeves up to look OK), and the neck is a bit tight with the hood pulling it back.  I figure to stretch the neck after it is washed. And I agree with another reviewer that it is sized a bit small.  I ordered an XL, which is usually quite roomy on my husband, but this has no extra room--I will never be able to put it in the dryer.  If I were ordering again, I would order the XXL.  I hope this will be helpful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "363   I owned a leather checkbook cover for nearly 13 years that was made by another company.  It wore so well that I said I'd never use vinyl again.  For the last five years I've been searching for a similar cover but was unable to come up with one that felt so supple while maintaining a quality firmness.  I like the way the edges are hemmed under and are not exposed.  I chose the tan color which was perhaps a little oranger than expected but hey, I can always see where I laid it down now.\\n\\nJef                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "367   I've used a similar bag for years. Thought it was time to change up. Saw this one. Liked the price and ordered one. Delivery was quick. I placed my order at 5:30P.M. on a Friday and received it in the mail the following Monday. Lots of room. I like the zippered main compartment. Plenty of smaller compartments for smaller items. It' a good bag for students or outdoor enthusiasts. Great for every day use.  This bag may last a week or it may service me for years. Either way it was a great deal. Besides, Jack Bauer uses one just like it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "372   This hoodie is very poorly made. I bought a blue version and I had to return it after washing it in COLD water on GENTLE.

       "374   I loved the look of the boot.  The price was great. I guess you get what you pay for.  They run a size small.  There is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location.  You break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off. Believe me, I tried.  I really wanted to keep the boots based on the look.  Once on, they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all.  I am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe.  I tend to be pretty easy.  I just could not make these work!

       "382   I really love this bag. It was perfect size for traveling around theme parks,  however the company sent me 3 duplicate bags by mistake and made a huge inconvenience to myself to send them back. They also took 4 days longer than expected to get it to me.Other than that it was great                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "384   This magnetic clip wallet is great! I've had mine for about a year now and it's worked out wonderfully. Do not worry about it messing with the magnetic strips on your credit/bank cards. I know this was a concern for me before I bought it, but it turned out to be a false impression. As far as the gentleman who had problems with it demagnetizing his room key, that's typical. In fact, since those are meant to be reprogrammed often, they are not nearly as strong as credit and bank cards. I've had loose change in my pocket demagnetize room keys before. \\n\\nKeep in mind the positives: Not only is it very compact, but can hold six credit cards/bank cards, a driver's license, and more. The leather wears very well. Moreover, it is small enough to fomfortably fit into the front pocket of my jeans.\\n\\nNegatives: Cannot hold fat wads of money, which isn't a problem for me but could be for others                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "392   Some information I'd like to share with future customers:\\n\\n* Not a drawstring waist.  Not an elastic waist either.  The waist is the same type of stretch seam as the legs, so be mindful of which opening is which when putting this on!\\n\\n* Fully lined, front and back, with light skin-tone 100% polyester.  The shell is labeled as given in the product description: 78% nylon, 22% Lycra/elastane/spandex.\\n\\n* Because of the polyester lining, this isn't a competition (i.e. very stretchy, very tight) suit.  Go ahead and order your regular waist size, you'll get a recreational fit.

       "406   Just a beautiful bag. I bought it for use with my 15\" Powerbook. The powerbook just barely fits, but it does fit, so don't use it with anything larger. The flap fastens with magnets which seems mostly to just keep it from flapping around, it does not keep the flap closed very securely. But the material is top notch and it looks fantastic. Highly recommended.\\n--- Update: 2 or 3 months after getting this bag, the leather which binds the shoulder strap to the main bag split, making the shoulder strap unusable. However, the seller has been extremely helpful in taking care of the situation, and the manufacturer is looking at the stitching in their design to see if it needs to be strengthened. I look forward to getting my great bag back                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "408   I am ex US Army, National Guard and Army Reserve.  I did not expect to receive dress web belts made in China and Taiwan from an Army Navy store.  I have other belts made in USA that are heavier materials (belt and buckle).  The belts have lasted 10 to 12 years and the buckles are still good as new!  I ordered 3 belts with buckles thinking I would not need to buy a new belt for the rest of my life.  The web material is very thin for a belt.  The buckles 2 out of 3 are stamped made in Taiwan and the 3rd has a sticker says made in China.  They are cheaply made and are likely to break or snag clothing.  I will not recommend this product to anybody.  After shipping this junk cost me $47.00 !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "415   I have been looking for a new wallet to replace the dinosaur I currently have.  My biggest issue is that I have several cards (hard and soft) that I have stuffed everywhere which made my old wallet big and unwieldy.  You could say it would be useful as a weapon it was so big. It would take me forever to find things. The Kenneth Cole wallet was just what I needed.  It has several pockets and since I hardly ever carry cash I can use the extra space for receipts and the soft cards. Much slimmer and lighter to carry. The change purse part is small but isn't a problem for me since I don't carry that much change anyway.  Since change is bulky by nature, I would prefer a separate change purse anyway.  The leather is very smooth and I love the avocado color--makes it stand out in the black hole that is my purse                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "417   These are a beautiful pair of pumps.  I love the tailored look I can wear with them:  trousers and a vest.  You get not just the ribbon ties as seen in the picture but also regular cord ties, though I think the ribbon is much more attractive.  The only complaint I have about these pumps is that there isn't a lot of padding inside, so as the day went on my foot would rub back and forth in the front and cause some friction.  Other than that they are wonderful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "423   I bought 2 Lilyette Embroidered Minimizer bra's here and both of them broke within one week.  I have never had such a negative experience with a product before.  Where the straps attach to the cup there is no strength in the attachment & they broke right away. Since I don't know how to get my money back or an adjustment, this cost me approx $60 for a loser of a purchase. My suggestion: Don't waste your money on this one                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "427   Thinking this jacket was made of fleece like material, i ordered it thinking it was a good buy. When i got it in the mail, a week later, i was soooooooooo disappointed. The material is like paper/ potato sack material... Its awful.. Like plastic...  I dont recommend u waste [...] on this .. The jacket is stylish no doubt... but the material not something u'd actually wear.. So a stylish jacket with bad material describes this jacket best.

       "435   I recently ordered 3 of these bags to use for grocery shopping in order to cut down/eliminate the number of paper and plastic bags  I need to dispose of or recycle...I also find brim full paper and plastic bags not easy to lug in from the car.   These bags are very well constructed, sturdy and roomy.   I remember years ago when grocery stores were giving canvas bags to customers to decrease the strain on the environment.   It was a good idea then, a great idea now...and these bags are perfect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

What a fleecing these people are trying to perpetuate on us.  It is just like those \"cheap\" cell phones on e-bay with $35 shipping charges.

I bought three pairs so I tossed out the first pair.\\n\\nThe next week I put on a new pair of socks, and once again by the end of the day there was a quarter sized hole in one of the heels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "454   Look what I found?  Where?  Under  there!  Under wear? ... Right there! It says, \"Be the first person to write a review\"  for Jockey Boxer Briefs.  Hmmmm...  no wonder no one has  reviewed these  yet -- who writes a review for men's underwear?  \\n\\nOk, fine, I'll do it.  I love these, my preferred brand and style. Your brand and your style may vary as this category of apparel tends to be a personal preference item.\\n\\nI only buy these in black as I am a firm believer that underwear (men's especially) should not be white -- as by the time the end of the day rolls around and it's time to change them  -- it's better to be left  wondering  what might be there as opposed to seeing it so prominently displayed on a white background!\\n\\nThese hold up well for the price.  Nothing lasts forever. The elastic band is usually the first to go (after many repeated washings) before the material gives out.  i.e. they will fall off before they rot off. \\n\\nFinally, so I can feel like I have done a complete job in reviewing these, I had a buddy of mine help with the ultimate test - the Weggie test - and these shorts handled it well...  extreme pain was reached well before the structure and/or material of the boxer short failed.  I give these a \"ten tippy toes\" rating for how well they performed in the test.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "461   The skin fits well and both chargers work perfectly (so far!)  Also, I was impressed with their extremely fast shipping.  I ordered it on Friday and had it by Tuesday, with Monday being a postal holiday!  Wow!  The skin is more flexible than I expected, but it stays in place nicely while allowing all the controls to be used normally.  The belt clip is a little weird, but I probably won't use it anyway.  I really like not having to carry the Vision:M's dongle around to charge it, now I can leave the dongle with it's USB cable and not worry about losing it.

       "464   Poor product.  No strap comes with this case.  Too difficult to get the iPod out for updates, whilst trying to pull out iPod can be dropped.  Front view cover is smeary and scratched.  Buttons are difficult to re-snap.

       "477   I recently quit smoking, and naturally gained some weight. We went on vacation, and while getting ready for the day, I noticed several bumps and buldges that weren't there before. Being the lazy person that I am, I decided to buy new, rather than diet and workout to lose the extra tonage! So the quest was on! I tried several different brands, and Playtex turned out to be the best fit for me. The range of sizes, and the flexabilty during movement is key for me.

       "487   This is advertised as a long line bra but I grew up calling it a bustier'. Regardless of what you call it let's just say it's a perfect combination of physical support and visually sexy. I have both the ivory and the black to wear with formal dresses. It also comes with removable straps so you can go strapless or not it's up to you. I prefer strapless, it adds to the illusion of Goddess.\\n\\nWearing this Goddess Bra makes me feel like a 1950's pin-up model especially when I wear it with lace panties and high heels. Honestly, it conjures up images of Rita Hayworth as Gilda and listening to the seductive singing of Julie London. \\n\\ngirldiver:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "493   I've been searching all over for a black sock to wear with dress loafers. I've worn pantyhose with the shoes but frankly socks are more comfortable. DKNY used to make a good sock for this purpose but they discontinued it. I don't like 'knee highs' or bulky fabric or a sock that is constricting at the top (bad for circulation). This sock is perfect! It's soft and resiliant and the height is just right (a bit below mid-calf). I feel like I could dance on air!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "495   I love wearing those tank tops with shelf bras or summer dresses that can't be worn with a bra...but the nipple issue was quite vexing. I didn't feel comfortable with any nip protrusion...the only disadvantage in having implants is that they tend to be a bit nipply. But, problem solved. These things rock                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "508   I love toeless hosiery, but these are the most uncomfortable pantyhose I have ever worn.  If I'm sitting down at all the backs of my thighs start to itch so horribly, and it gets worse when I stand.  These are awful, I can't stand it.  The only good things I can say are unlike some toeless pantyhose I have worn in the past, the toe thong does not bind, and the lightest color actually is light enough for my skin tone, but it is so not worth the itching.  Also, they run rather large, the material doesn't have nearly enough stretch and they bag around the ankles and knees.  I'm only 5 feet tall but out over 120 lbs. and the smallest size is still too big.  I'll give Hue's a try and I might even spring for the Donna Karan toeless panythose, but I won't get these ones again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "515   Just a note to say the this t-shirt has some good things going for it. It is the size that it says it is. Medium is really a Medium is NOT really a Large. The printing held up well in the wash and the fabric isn't chintzy so there's no see-through going on. I would reccommend this shirt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "518   This shirt is 100% crinkle cotton.  It has a slightly rougher texture because of the crinkle, but is not stiff or uncomfortable.  It seems to be well-made and the colors are very bright.  It will shrink in the wash (unless you do all cold), but it is fairly true to size, if not a little on the large side.  It's also not too short, which is nice for those with longer torsos.  In the blue color the shirt looks nice enough to be worn as a semi-dressy blouse.  It's good enough to wear to the office                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "519   Levi's are usually my choice of brand for jeans and pants. So when Levi's introduced this new fit, the Slim Straight, I purchased a pair and tried it out. The 514 has a very large range of sizes and trendy washes, and is usually on sale for a very reasonable price at $30.\\n\\nI recommend this fit for thin men, tall or short, who I think look best on. Men who aren't comfortable with wearing tight jeans shouldn't purchase this fit, because it is certainly figure revealing. It's slimmer around the thigh, unlike the Skinny 511 jeans, where it's much tighter around both the calf and the thigh. The waist is a low rise, which I find very comfortable while wearing, and the leg opening is a straight cut. The 514 shrinks slightly when washed and dried.\\n\\nI personally think this fit is better looking than the Skinny 511, which I believe is just a fad for now. The Skinny has a sort of tapered-mom-jean look to it, and I don't think anyone will agree that a guy looks good in that! I suggest you try these jeans out before buying them, and see how you like them.

       "534   Did not fit well AT ALL.  WAY too big around the ankles - every step I took, the boot would start to fall off.  They were the right size, length wise and all, just way too wide above my ankle.  They were about half as tall as they looked in the photo, which was very disappointing.  I sent the boot back at my own expense the same day.  I would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first, then ordering it off of here for cheaper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "543   This cami fits well, does not ride up & gives enough support (I'm a 36C). It's pretty low though I do wish the neck line was a little higher. Over all it is pretty & very comfty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "544   The checkbook cover itself is functional and works fine.  However, the odor from it could about knock you over.  I have yet to actually put it to use because it has been sitting on the shelf for three days, in the hopes that it will air out some (so far, to no avail.)  I am not kidding - it smells awful!  Whatever products they used to cure the leather left it smelling so indescribably terrible.  It isn't just a \"leather\" smell.  Trust me, I have leather shoes, coats, car seats, furniture, purses...I know what leather smells like, and this ain't it.  It is practically toxic.  The first day I opened it, my office smelled so bad that it gave me a headache. \\n\\nI would advise you to look elsewhere                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "548   I really like this swaddler. My twins resist being swaddled (but they sleep much better swaddled) so it's important to me to have something that's fast and easy to use. I stopped using the sack when my babies outgrew it, and now I only used the outer wrap. I removed the top piece of velcro on the back of the wrap (designed to attach to the sack) because it seems like it could be irritating. I know that there's some SIDS rationale for using the sack plus the wrap, but I do the wrap really tight so I'm confident that there's no way it could come off and get over my babies' heads.\\n\\nSome tips: I tighten the velcro iteratively -- I wrap the baby snuggly once, then I open up each half and re-tighten it. Also, I wrap the bottom half of my babies in a snug traditional swaddle with a blanket. They like having their legs tightly wrapped, and this system allows me to focus on their arms with the Halo wrap and on their legs with a blanket                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "550   Took me quite a while to find an appropriate raincoat but I highly recommend this one. It is of good quality (something very important to me), lightweight and stylish enough to be worn over business work or casual clothing.  It has the added bonus of a detachable liner which itself is quite warm.   I found something very similar (without a liner) at Saks Fifth Avenue for $395 and could not see myself (or anyone else, for that matter) plunking down that much for a raincoat.  Overall, this coat is at great price and it is a great buy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "551   I ordered 2 for gifts and 1 for myself based on other reviews. I was not disappointed! The bag is large and roomy, made of heavy-duty material, with outside pocket, and has a neat little clasp to hook your keys, etc. for easy finding.  It will make the perfect beach bag for us, and could be used for almost anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "553   My husband bought this bag for me for our anniversary.  I love it!!  I want it in some of the other great colors. I love the pockets on the inside.  It does not look or feel like a big bag but has a lot of room on the inside.  Overall, a great buy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

It's electronic all right, but it trades that for quality. The blade is made of flimsy plastic, and doesn't stay in the hilt when pointed downward (when \"deactivated\"). On the other hand, it is a pretty good flashlight. If you are going to buy it, buy it because it's the cheapest electronic lightsaber you can get new, not for the quality                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "580   Some weeks ago I bought two  \"Prana Yoga Tank\" (one 100% cotton and a Dry Tech one) and an \"yoga Momentum Short\". \\nI am very satisfied about the great comfort in wearing and the beautiful style of these products.\\nBut what I don't understand is the fact I can wash them only cold. How is that possible; normaly you can wash cotton cloths at least in 40 degrees Celcius.\\nAlso my 100 % synthetic running gear I can wash in 40 degrees. \\n \\nSince I practice a rather active form of yoga I also sweat a lot.\\nIt think would be more fresh / hygienic if I could wash my Prana clothing at least on 40 degrees !\\nWhy does Prana design beautiful sports wear you can't wash in a proper way ??                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "585   I bought this jacket for my mother, who is always cold.  The vendor was National Products (not amazon.com) and it was quickly shipped and received.  I have to say that it shed a good bit when I tried it on to determine if it was the right size, but I think that's normal for chenille. \\n\\nMy mother tells me that she wears it all the time and it's extremely warm.  The jacket itself was very pretty and comfortably sized, but not ridiculously so.  So while I can't attest to it first hand, it seems to have been a nicely made, attractive and effective product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "589   I was hoping to wear this for my daughter's Easter Christening. Well, no dice. It's extremely cheap (very light material, frayed at the edges, and the embellishments seem just ironed on), big and boxy, and the lining leaves little to the imagination.

My only concern is that the shoulder strap is thinner than I would have prefered, but so far it is holding up to the job just fine.  There are several pockets inside so it can hold quite a bit, and the phone pocket on the side he chooses to use for his IPod!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "596   I got this shirt in white and hunter green. I get complements on the hunter green one each time I wear it b/c 'that's a great color on you!' I really like the shirts over all.\\n\\nThey really do RUN SMALL. You will certainly need to order a bigger size. They are kind'a thin too and the white one is a bit see-through                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "607   I bought this jacket as a Christmas present for my brother (since he was going snowboarding). Well, the snowboarding plans fell through, but he wears it all the time. Since, being a teenage boy, he's not very verbal, the best I can say about this jacket is that he didn't want me to return it and said that it keeps him warm. I've also seen him wearing the fleece part alone, which he's also said is very warm.

       "608   Locks are solid, dependable quality.  However, security officers seemed to cut mine open straight away even though these are supposed to be of the kind they are able to open with a key.  I don't think they bother with the extra labour and just use the bolt cutters straight away.  Kinda disappointing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "624   I take no pleasure in this review.  I just received (March 2007) my 3rd pair of Vasque Sundowners. I'd used up my GTX Sundowners (4th pair of Vasque boots) that I've had for about 3 years.  This is the first pair that squeaks.  I like good shoes, and I like taking care of them.  I had always been proud to wear Vasque, but the quality of these is just not that great.  The leather is thinner, and is dimpling, so they even look cheaper.  It's a shame, I wish Red Wing (another brand I`ve enjoyed in the past) had not acquired Vasque. It is the end of a great tradition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "632   These shoes do EVERYTHING!!! They are the perfect dress shoe, but just casual enough to wear with jeans. If you want to be classy, the ivory and dark brown are great colors. If you want to be girly, the cotton candy does that for you. Or, if you want to be funky, the blue ithiga is perfect.

       "642   I have run in a pair of 991s for the last 5 years.  I was disappointed to hear that the 991 was replaced by the 992.  I purchased a pair of 992 hoping for similar comfort and fit.  The 992s are nice to look at, but the similarities stop there.  The fit is horrible even after going down from a D to a B width.  The cushioning I've come to love in the 991 is simiply not there in the 992.  I had a New Balance representative tell me point blank that he wouldn't recommend the 992 for running at all.  What is that old adage?  If it's not broke don't fix it.  Did New Balance even test this shoe before implementing it?  991 lovers beware, this shoe is not for you.  I guess the quest begins for a new running shoe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "644   I love this product, and the rest of the Pack-It system, beyond all reason.  I've given them as gifts repeatedly.\\n\\nIn effect, they give you \"drawers\" in your suitcase, and sub-drawers within the drawers of hotel dressers.  It's easy to take out a pair of slacks without disarranging everything else. \\n\\nThe 18\" folder works well for womens' shirts, blouses, and slacks.  I can easily fit say three pairs of slacks and two shirts into it.  If you want to carry more or fewer pieces, it's forgiving.  I use it for suit jackets too, folding them in across the width of the folder.\\n\\nI've used mine often over perhaps 8 years, and they still look like new.\\n\\nA standard-sized 21\" roll-aboard suitcase will neatly hold: 1 18-inch folder (this product), two full-sized Pack-It cubes, a small pack-it sac holding travel adapters and rechargers, a toiletries bag (not from this sytem) and a pair of shoes (squeezed).

       "649   These silk pajamas, in my opinion, have much higher quality stitching, tailoring details, as well as a heavier weight silk than the closely priced DreamSacks pajamas.  \\n\\nSizing Help:\\n\\nTo help clarify sizing for people (there have been conflicting reviews here), I ordered a Medium but then returned it for a L.  I will probably get some minor alterations, but I don't blame the company for that...everyone is shaped differently.\\n\\nI am 6'0\" and weigh 175.  My suit measurements are a 42\" chest, 34\" sleeves, and 32\" pants inseam.  The Medium body fit but the sleeves and pants were too short.  The Large was the best fit overall, although roomier around the chest than I would prefer.  But if you are my size the Large is your best option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "652   These are so great, but I just wish the stickyness would last longer.  I have no complaints though.  \\n\\nI do have to say that at first, I did experience a little itching, but I'm pretty sure that was just due to the fact I was putting something new on that I'd never felt before.  It went away within a few hours.\\n\\nAnd they do work well to prevent leaks, but just to be sure, check every now & then to make sure milk isn't building up too much in there.  I had to release some build up milk every now & then.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "653   The footbed feels just a tad different than the original birkenstock, somehow it hugs your heel more, but still a most comfortable sandal.  The shape of the heel is also not the conventional birkenstock, it is very slightly angled out, hardly noticable, and still attractive.  For the price, any slight differences don't matter.  It is still an extremely high quality flat sandal that will mean happy feet and legs, and a happy back for years to come.  Highly recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "655   I bought this case for my boyfriend and I.  We both like that it fits great over the player.  The armband is a little uncomfortable when you use it over a long period of time.  The power button is a little hard to use with the cover on, but it does not affect the wheel.  Overall the cover serves its purpose of protecting the player                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "658   About the \"red flag: reviewer: This person ordered a children's sized sweater. I ordered this same sweater, properly, for my 8-year-old daughter, and it fits accordingly. Liz Claibourne makes a great product for the price - they are pretty much true to size. It is VERY IMPORTANT to pay attention to whether you are ordering children's clothing or adult clothing. Give me a break!

       "660   I got the black one for my wife when it was on sale at $19.99. Looks very nice on her and the logo and pattern on the back of the top looks really cool. The only thing is that the pants are a bit long for her but not too bad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

The kind of people with whom I want to do more business                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "667   You'd be surprised about how much this bag holds! The only problem is that it's big enough fora laptop, but doesn't offer any protection for it.

       "668   Living in the south there is little need for this coat, but when you need it...you need it. I don't know what the person below is talking about. The coat is not thin, perhaps compared to a parka, but its certainly heavier than a business suit coat. Seems a little big at 44 Regular. Mine arrived well packed, no problem with wrinkles even after leaving it in a heap in the back seat of the truck.

       "670   I have been wearing Wrangler Angler Jeans exclusively for the last 8+ years. The fit is the best. The extra pockets on the right leg come in handy to carry small tools and a pen. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the material is a little light (in weight and color) so they tend to look too worn out too fast. But I can usually get about 18 months out of a pair. The Tan ones wear longer and look good longer. I am truly a fan and hope they make these for a long time to come                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "671   i ordered this wallet for a christmas gift.  i was very happy when i first looked it over.  the lining is throughout the whole wallet, no nook and cranny unturned.  the leather is soft and a beautiful color.  the gift was for a young man (26 years old, new yorker) with a unique yet classic style. he really loved it.  however the downside was its SIZE.  it is ulta thin but very wide.  i recommend wearing it in a jacket pocket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "672   These tighty whiteys are close to being a perfect everyday bikini. However, as another reviewer noted, there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin. I'm normally a 32 waist and the pairs that I own are for my size, medium 32-34. Streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam, but I've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this. Maybe buying the next size up would work, but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and I like keeping 'em close to home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "675   In general, I don't think much of the manufacture of the scrubs that are sold for medical professionals.  I thought Dickies would be the best, but found they are mostly like the others.  After I received these, I ordered Dove Apparel, which are more expensive but thicker of material and sturdier of make                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "682   I just received the boots last night.  I love them!  The fit is a bit snug(I ordered a 7.5 but have a slightly wide foot), but have plenty of room at the heel. I'll just wear medium weight socks.  There is a thin adjustable black top above the fur. Handy to keep the snow out but the photo doesn't show that.

       "691   I love the Italian Leather Key Chain --it is made very sturdy and you can either clip it to your jeans or your bag for easy access.

       "693   The suit arrived quickly and is beautifully made. However, the information in the add says it is 100% Wool. It is not. The label clearly says 100% Polyester.  That is a problem if you are expecting a natural fibre. I have kept the suit because it is for a production and it looks great but would have preferred it to be wool so it could be retailored at another time. I will still use this company because of the fast and efficient service and also, because of how well the garment was made                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "703   this is a good product.\\n\\nIt effectively cleans water of microbiological contaminants (including viruses) through a layered filtration system and iodine-releasing resin (and among the only EPA certified bottles to do it). It is not heavy and leaves the water with a slight iodine taste (much more subtle than using iodine tablets). Each filtration system, which screws into the inside of the water bottle, lasts about 26 gallons (about 100 liters) after which you have to replace it, costing about US$22. \\n\\nI have been using the bottle in rural peru and have had no problems. I would recommend this product for anyone venturing into areas with unknown water sanitation, all you need is the bottle and a puddle, stream, river, etc. I don't know its results against pesticides, arsenic, lead, etc. but for short term use this is a great product                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

It is too big for that!!!! \\n\\nI am on my 2nd one so far, the first got all stretched out and loose from all the things I had crammed in it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "721   This deal was a dream, I have been around from Walmart to Radio Shack, and more. No matter where it was I looked for a wall charger, or the AV cables they was over priced (in my opinion at least) I saw the AV cables for 15, or more, and the Home Wall Charger was 20 to 30, so when I found this deal I wen't nuts. To get a Wall Charger, a Car Charger, and AV Cables! All for 30 dollars! Now thats a deal! I have tryed each one, of these out, and they work wonderful! I recommend this to everyone who has an iPod                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "723   I have never, ever before had on a pair of crotchless panties and I have to say that I liked it. Mostly I don't wear panties, unless I'm wearing a dress or a skirt and sometimes even then I don't. I just like the freedom. But these, these are cute as can be and it's like you don't have anything on at all. At least that's's the way it feels. And they are darn beautiful. Darn beautiful. The discovery of these panties have really made this lingerie party for me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "729   This is a perfect wallet for the woman who just wants to cut down in the confusion in her purse when she is reaching for her credit cards and checkbook. The wallet has 15 credit card slots (and you can carry more if you double up), and a window for your driver's license conveniently located on the checkbook flap. The zippered compartment is wide, and has two big open pockets for your bills, and papers; a credit card holder(that's part of the 15 counted) and a center zippered compartment. I am on my second Big Fat Wallet. It is the only wallet that fits all my stuff. I can go to the ATM and immediately put my cash in this wallet and zipper it up. I don't have to fumble trying to stuff it into slim pockets like other wallets I have owned. The new edition (which is the one pictured here) has an extra fastener so it can accomodate your wallet's growth, and stay closed. It also has a pocket under the front flap.  The only complaint is that the ID window that you could pull out out from the back pocket and then have it \"pop\" back doesn't do that anymore. Instead of a elastic band that attached the window to the wallet, Mundi substituted a plastic fastner..like the kind that stores use to hang price tags on clothes. All in all, for a leather wallet at this low price, you can't go wrong. Yes, the leather isn't glove soft or for that matter a high quality leather, but I'd rather not have a flashy expensive wallet.

       "732   I love the look. Even my friends complement it. And the wedges are so LIGHT! But you got to stick to your size.

       "740   This is nothing but a nylon bag and a zip loc mylar baggie. It didn't work to keep things dry at a recent trip to the water park despite double bagging. All that was in it was a set of keys, some cash & cards. These items managed to push open the seal of the mylar baggie. I would not recommend this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "741   I placed order on 10/10. I called Blue Blood racing the shipper because i did find any shipping info on amazon and was that as of the 10/16 that my order had not been shipped. I that it would be shipped that day. I was told that I may get my item 10/23 or 10/ 24. Horrible customer service. The shipper also told me that there was some kind of problem with my shoe that is what took so long, but i was not contacted and told that there was a delay in receiving my item. I will not order from Blue Blood Racing again!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "744   It's a very cute case. I got mine in pink. It's small and light but it could be the tiniest fraction larger so the DS fits better. The corners hit the rounded sides of the case and it can't fit fully in the case. You can still zip it up fine, however so I'm all aroun                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "752   I discovered Dorfman Pacific ball caps about five years ago when I bought a great American flag logoed cap in Chatham, Mass., in a high-end men's clothing store. I have tried to contact the company to purchase more hats, but apparently they sell only to retail distributors, not individual customers. I wear baseball caps often and these fit perfectly. The brim is strong and the hat doesn't ride high on your head. If you care about how caps look and feel, I would strongly suggest purchasing a Dorfman ball cap                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "754   Bag was well made, but too small.  Can't put much in it.  Nice well-made leather bag.

       "755   I am very happy to see this top back in spring colors! I bought this top in the fall for my daughter who is attending college in Florida & myself.  I have received numerous compliments as the embroidery is perfect - not flashy or overbearing at all. When Amber called & told me she loved hers, I almost couldn't believe I had picked out clothes she liked! It is very comfortable and breathable being 100% cotton.  The crew neck is not too high, the 3/4 sleeves span the seasons well for us in CA & FL - Great top!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "757   I thought I was going to save a few bucks and buy my next Combat Boots from Amazon to get the cheapest price.  The seller was totally fine, however the boots were total crap.  The leather was unbelievably stiff and hard, so I thought I would just use a ton of leather conditioner... about 15 applications and I don't think it made a difference.  I put the boots on to try and \"break them in\" - lost cause there, but in addition, nearly half the eyelets came right out of the lether, first or second time trying the boots on.  I would have returned the, except I had shined and polished, and oiled the boots so much.  Don't buy, stick with Altama or another Military Issue brand boot.  I am sticking with my Altama pair I have had for 7 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "774   I went searching for an iPod wall charger b/c my 60 GB video ipod didn't come with one (grrrrr! apple!) and it was $30.  Sigh.  But okay I thought....I'll get it.  Then I went searching for an A/V cord at the store.  $15-$25 and neither of them worked.  I couldn't figure out why??  It works for my miniDV camera but not my iPod?  Do you I really have to purchase the $99 ipod A/V accessory kit???  \\n\\nThen, gold struck.  And I stumbled across this on amazon.  It all works and it works beautifully and it looks beautiful and to boot, I got a charger for my car (something i won't use much seeing how I don't currently drive much now but hey, i will someday) and I got it all for less than $30.  I don't know how they do it, but this is a great deal.  A must if you own a video iPod and don't want to spend another $150 dollars on accessories for it.  \\n\\nPlus, fast shipping too!

My suggestion: go for the crotchless OR the bustless OR the fishnet, but all three is just not enough lingeree and too much girlfriend..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "793   I just mailed those back this past week to Beall's in Florida.  However,\\nwhen the mailman took it from my mailbox (I am 83 and no car) he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it.  There was $l.71 due.  So, I put  (5) 39 cent stamps on it, which would have been \\n$1.95.  However, the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I  had put on  it.  I called the post office, and fortunately, the postmistress believed I was being honest, and told me to send it back with the mailman.  He wasn't a happy camper, but I did send it back, and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me.  I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange.  Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips....they were okay, but by that time, I had changed my mind about them, too.\\nAlso, I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it.\\nJeanne Alle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "802   These silk pajamas, in my opinion, have much higher quality stitching, tailoring details, as well as a heavier weight silk than the closely priced DreamSacks pajamas.  \\n\\nSizing Help:\\n\\nTo help clarify sizing for people (there have been conflicting reviews here), I ordered a Medium but then returned it for a L.  I will probably get some minor alterations, but I don't blame the company for that...everyone is shaped differently.\\n\\nI am 6'0\" and weigh 175.  My suit measurements are a 42\" chest, 34\" sleeves, and 32\" pants inseam.  The Medium body fit but the sleeves and pants were too short.  The Large was the best fit overall, although roomier around the chest than I would prefer.

       "818   It came at the right time, I was searching for wallets on-line when I decided to check out amazon.com. Well to my amazement, there was exactly what I had been looking for, the zippered wallet with a  snap-closure change pocket inside. \\nThe wallet is great, have been putting a little mink oil on it, in an effort to soften leather. It would be nice, if it had more card slots, but overall I am very satisfied. Gotten a lot of positive coments on my wallet,  like the added little security of the zipper closure.\\nAnyway thanks again, and to think that I all I needed to do was check (Amazon.com)first, to locate those hard to find items                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "822   This is a great starter thong\\n\\nI have not had good luck with the thongs I've tried in the past.  I heard that if you try them out for a week, you'll love 'em and never go back to normal underwear again.  Well, I couldn't even make it 2 days straight with my \"starter thong\".    I don't know what brand it was, but it sure wasn't comfortable.\\n\\nThis Hanky Panky 4811 thong is very nice.  I read a bunch of reviews and just had to try it.   I put it on one evening after work, and I even wore it to bed!\\n\\nIt is comfortable, and stays put pretty well.   It doesn't hurt when I bend over, like the other thongs I tried.\\n\\nAND... it fits me well.   I am a size 16/18 and I have no problems with the size.  It stretches nicely, and does not dig in on my hips, or anywhere else.  It fits perfectly!\\n\\nI will definirely be buying more of these, they're great                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "828   OK, I found my fiance online, why not my wedding dress -- sounds easy in comparison, right? Well, after three months of looking (offline, too), I was ready to give up. We're having a very small, relatively casual outdoor May wedding, and I couldn't find anything that really fit my idea of what I want to wear. Then I found Tension Dress (bad name!) on Amazon.\\n\\nI bought the ivory in one size larger than I usually wear (XL, even though generally I'm a 12), since it looked like juniors sizing and I'm 5'10\". It fits perfectly (and since the back laces up, you have a little \"wiggle room\" in the fit). I'm planning to have it shortened to tea length (the only adjustment I'll need to make), but even at my height the full length is just right with a 2.5\" heel.\\n\\nThe fabric looks and feels nicer in person than in the photos on the site. I actually ended up ordering it directly from gojane.com's site, since they had more size and color options than were showing up on Amazon. Even with expedited shipping (I ordered it Sunday night, late, and it was here by Thursday afternoon), the total was less than $100. Not bad for a beautiful wedding dress! I couldn't be more pleased. And after the wedding, maybe I'll dye it and wear it for other occasions. Although at this price, I could even buy one in another color...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "830   I purchased the Olympia Rolling Computer Tote to alleviate shoulder pain from carrying my laptop to and from the office every day.  It has suited my needs very well, although it would be nice if the case were just a bit larger.  There is room for my laptop and my wallet, a couple of file folders, and little else.  One more outside pocket would have been nice, but at this price, the case more than meets my expectations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "834   I was very specific looking for this gown. I bought it in the navy color because I wanted to be sure it wasn't see through. I live in Singapore where it's very hot and humid year round. It's common for me to have to take 2 showers a day. So, in the evenings it's nice to put this lightweight sleeveless gown on to help stay cool. I love the length and because of the way it's gathered around the bustline, it's loose fitting and not obvious you don't have a bra on. I'll definitely be getting another one or two of these down the road.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "836   Very Good Bag.  Spacious. Perfect for the College Student on the Move.

       "845   I love this jacket. It fits really nice in the shoulders, but the bottom looks like a maternity jacket. I wear a 16/18 and I got xxx-large, I wish I would have gotten a xx-large. Its on the big side but it gives me a lot of room to wear my wool sweaters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "847   I purchased the non-premium kit ($9.99) with a Silicone skin case cover and 2 screen protectors (one for each screen), but it is the same case.  The problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery, twice as slippery as the Nintendo Lite without the cover. We thought that washing them in Dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness, but that didn't work. After handling the cover, your hands have a slippery residue on them.  The other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection, not impact protection.  The screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok, I guess, but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised (trust me, the screen was clean).  \\n\\nI purchased 2 kits, and I had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort.  I do not recommend this product at all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "851   This polo is absolutely fabulous! I love the length, it comes down to my hips. I bought it in the size I usually wear and it fits great! I wore it under a little khaki jacket with jeans and it looked fantastic. I can't wait to buy it in every color                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "854   This dress was everything it promised to be and more.  It was beautiful and has held up very well.  Food got on her dress--all down the front--the second time she wore it, but it washed up well and is no worse for the wear--you can't even tell.  My daughter loved this dress!  She felt like a princess!  The off white is not as stark as plain white and it works well for multiple occassions.  It's a perfect dress for the little girl/or bigger girl who wants to look a little more grownup and elegant but still wants that \"princess dress\" feel.  We love the dress and will recommend it to you highly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "855   This is a truly delightful scarf.  It's very soft and buttery, lightweight, and long.  The drape is incredible.  You can wear it just around your neck or drape it over your head first and it looks stunning.\\n\\nInitially, I got the winter lilac color, which is actually magenta.  Very pretty color.  I loved it so much, I bought the ivory, black, and cassis (a dark burgundy).  This was a good thing, because my six-year-old daughter cabbaged onto the first one.  Imagine that: A scarf a child actually *wants* to wear.  I love this scarf so much, I'm going to buy the other colors I don't have yet.\\n\\nWe had a very cold, windy winter this year, and I wore one of these scarves every day.  They kept me warm without being oppressively heavy.  They also roll up into almost no space at all, so they're ideal for travel or having in your bag \"just in case.\"\\n\\nThe scarf is 100% acrylic, and the one drawback is that it's dry-clean only.  I suspect handwashing would be okay, though.  Even if you have to baby it a bit, it's worth it for the exquisite texture.\\n\\nI highly recommend this scarf.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "858   ...These are great!  On the one hand, they are quite ordinary.  No fancy sticthing, exaggerated fashion or overly tight crotch.  Yet the quality workmanship and attention to detail takes this usual design for briefs and makes it into an unusually appealing item.  As advertized, the waistband construction lies flat and does not roll, and the contour pouch gives good, but realistic, definition that can be appreciated by others.

       "859   I ordered the black one. According to the photo provided, it was supposed to be black with white seams, but when i received it, it was all black. Once I put it on it fitted perfectly. But it is simply too difficult to put on even though it is the right size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "862   I have been looking for the perfect swim suit for this season, and I was pretty sure that I was going to have to spend about 100$ which may not be much to some, but for me, ouch. This company had amazingly fast shipping, I am absolutely awe struck. It was here within a week even though the predicted time was that it would be \"SHIPPED\" in like 2 weeks. The product is super cute, good material. The only thing is I had to kind of guess on the size, they didn't really give a swim suit sizing method, but if you think about it, whenever you buy online it is a guessing game. Great shipping, affordable price, and not a cheaply made product. It's an adorbable swim suit, and I'll most likely check here first for next years swim suit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "872   While much of the negative commentary concerned Levi Strauss's move away from domestic manufacturing has focused on the button-fly 501s, the bigger problem I have seen is with the old 1970's standby, the 505, which has a zipper as opposed to button fly. The variability on sizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order. You really have to try them on to see how they fit. The 501 are much easier to buy online or by mail order because the sizing is much less critical on the waist, which is the so-called \"anti-fit\" waist, meaning there is no curve to the rise (the distance between the crotch and the top of the waist), because the original 501s were merely cut down bib overalls which were made to hang, rather than be fitted to the waist. The biggest problem I have noted on the 505's is the variability in size in the thigh area, meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight, even though they are theoretically the same size of a label. Since the 501s are more forgiving as far as sizing, if you are buying online you might consider them instead of 505s, unless you don't want the button fly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "884   Does not say on amazons site that these are shipped in narrow widths only.  Supplier does not carry the wide ones.  Birkenstocks are normally wide unless you specify narrow widths.  Not here.  No exchange possible.  Now I'm stuck with shoes that don't fit and midwest sports couldn't care less. I won't ever order from them again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "889   I am a huge fan of Under Armour's workout apparel, and in addition to owning several of these Tech T-shirts, also own several each of the Loose Gear shirts (0084) and the Heat Gear compression shirts (0039) - I've written reviews on those as well.\\n\\nThe Tech T-shirt (0382) feels really good on your skin - like your favorite, most comfortable old cotton t-shirt. It looks just like cotton and has a matte finish - it's not shiny/silky like the Loose Gear shirts or Heat Gear compression shirts. It is very soft, comfortable and lightweight, and I love this shirt both for working out and casual wear. The shirt runs true to size (buy your regular T-shirt size and it will fit really well), and is the roomiest cut of the Under Armour shirts. I absolutely LOVE the raglan sleeves on the tech tee - one of the features that makes them so comfortable and gives them a little bit of a unique look.\\n\\nThe tech tee has a small amount of a lycra-like fabric in with the polyester microfiber, which gives it quite a bit of stretch. I like this because the shirt doesn't bind if you're doing something that really requires you to reach or stretch - certain weight exercises, aerobics, yoga, etc. The shirt works the way it's supposed to, and wicks moisture from your skin for rapid evaporation.\\n\\nThe tech tee is available in numerous colors (I have 6 of them) and in spite of the fact that the fabric is thin and lightweight, the shirts are very opaque. The shirts have a nice cut and look great over jeans or shorts - in addition to the gym, I often wear them out and around, or when working in the yard. They are super comfortable worn as an undershirt too, but are probably a little costly for that. Like all the Under Armour shirts, they have a self-material neck band, but it fits just right and says in place, even if you get sweaty - it doesn't sag like the cotton ones.\\n\\nWhile I have zero complaints about the tech tee, be aware that it is Under Armour's \"budget\" product, if there is such a thing. The material does start to pill after a few washings - this affects appearance slightly, but not performance or fit. Although I haven't worn out ANY of my Under Armour shirts yet, I'm going to venture that the tech t-shirt won't be quite as durable as their signature Loose Gear shirts and Heat Gear compression shirts, nor does it perform quite as well. On the other hand it, it's about 20% cheaper, so as with anything else, you get what you pay for.\\n\\nWhen stacked up against UA's other shirts, I'd say the tech tee is for you if:\\n\\n1) You like the look and feel of a soft, cotton t-shirt but want the wicking and performance of a microfiber shirt.\\n\\n2) You don't care for the shiny, silky, more synthetic look and feel of the Loose Gear shirts, or the tightness of the Heatgear compression shirt.\\n\\n3) You want a shirt that's a little roomier.\\n\\n4) You want a shirt with stretch in it.\\n\\n5) You want to save a little $$ but still wear an authentic UA logo shirt   \n",
       "892   It's awful. the S size is too big for me (My waistline is 34 and in the sizing chart it says \"size S fits 26-36\")so i end up cut it and sew it back so it can fit on me. Then after 3 days of wearing it, the velcro is messed up, it can not attached together anymore. The costumer service is an answering machine (I tried several times to call the costumer service, and only get the machine answer my call). I can not return the item, because it says its illegal to return this kind of item. So my advise, dont buy this item or you'll be sorry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "898   I just returned from two weeks of birding in Brazil. We hiked for miles each day and the Tilley's Travel Socks were very comfortable in the hot tropical locations as well as in the cooler mountain regions. I took three pair with me as well as some regular socks, just in case I did not like the new Tilley's Travel Socks.  From now on, I can save on packing space and weight by just taking the Tilley's Travel Socks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "901   For some reason, parasols for the photosensitive are hard to find -- most are hideously expensive and not very good looking. The House of Rice silk parasol, however, is an exception to the rule. They manage to be pretty, useful and surprisingly sturdy.\\n\\nExcept for a white, painted handle, the parasol's frame is entirely made of bamboo. It looks fragile, but is surprisingly sturdy, especially since it is bound together with colorful threads and bamboo pegs. Over that is asemi-transparent pale yellow silk canopy, and a matching ribbon on the top to hang it from.\\n\\nHow does it stand up in the sun? Well, the silk is technically transparent, but when unfolded it does provide a certain amount of shade -- about the same as a pair of sunglasses. Aesthetically, it is also very good, simple and unadorned except by a few extra scraps of silk, but very elegant and understated. The only problem is that to keep the parasol open, you have to essentially shove it up onto a jutting wedge of bamboo. It's a bit of a pain to close.\\n\\nThe House of Rice silk parasol is meant to look pretty, but it can also be used for the parasol's origina function. Definitely a good find, if you can get it closed easily                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "910   One of the things about this suit is that if you are an avid swimmer like I am, do not wear it to the pool, because the chlorine will eat it up (the rear end of the suit, right along the seam, usually goes first). Otherwise it is great for swimming and sunning, it offers minimal coverage without being obscene. If if wasn't for the fact that this suit wear out so easily if you don't take care of it, it would be perfect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "920   Finally I have found a quality brand of swimsuit I can order on line and know it will fit.  I'm a daily swimmer who is long-bodied.  This particular style fit great when it arrived; it arrived quickly within four days; shipping was free; and the lycra material is the most resilient I know given the chlorine bashing my suits get.  Please continue to sell this particular item at a price lower than the sports stores.

       "921   This is a nice gazebo.  It's not the cheap $50 job that breaks the first time you try to use it.  Consists of three pieces: 1) the frame that folds out like a huge accordian deal, 2) the nylon (like tent fabric) top that fits snugly on with velcro straps, 3) the case. Takes maybe five minutes to set up, if you're slow. Has three height settings, and you can stake it into the ground too, if you are on grass. It has feet that enable it to be fastened to a wood deck too, if necessary.  Comes with a nice black case with wheels and easy-to-carry handles.  It's a little difficult to get the fabric folded up and packed into the case, though.  Other than that, it's perfect.  It's a buy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "923   The Lands End 60/40 Oxford is THE dress shirt to own!  It is the end of the line in your search for an excellent product!  I buy nothing but this shirt, and have multiple shirts in each color made.  I've worn a shirt and tie nearly every day since I was 16 years old in prep school (35 years now), and the Lands End is the best.  I highly recommend this shirt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "926   Thank you GoJane. Tension dress is so beautiful. I just got the dress today and I'm so happy. I cannot believe that such a very cute and beautiful dress of a very good material is only less than $100. I am small. It's very difficult for me to get a wedding dress of my size. I bought my wedding dress last month (it was much more expensive than Tension dress) but it was still a little big for me and it's nothing compared to Tension dress in terms of cuteness. I bought ivory Tension dress, x-small, and it fits me very well and looks really cute on me. Thank you GoJane. You save my wedding when I almost give up looking for a cute wedding dress of my size                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "932   I was leary about buying this as it is shipped from Equador and I wasn't sure what the quality would be. It is awesome and I love it! The leather could not be nicer and although it looks small at first glance, it fits so much in it. It was a great purchase and the shipment was fairly quick. I am real happy with it. You'll love it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "939   I have owned this drag suit for about six months and it is still as nice (not discolored in the slightest) as it was when I first bought it. Six months is not an extremely long amount of time, but when you consider that it lasted through a three month swim season with two hour practices 6 days a week, in a pool filled with chlorine, the quality is undeniable. The Speedo company has proven that it designs quality products and this drag suit is no exception                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "941   I love these shorts and I love the fact it hides NOTHING! Considering I have quite a bit to show off anyway. When I'm exercising I love the fact that both men AND women love to stare \"there\" if you know what I mean. It's definitely an ego booster                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "945   I bought the Harry Potter Gryffindor V-neck sweater off of Whimsic Alley and hoped that the colors on this tie wouldn't be too red for it.  Fortunately, the burgundy color is a bit darker than on the picture on this site, and it went PERFECTLY with the sweater.  It's slightly large, but if you manage the knot on the tie, it still makes a good size for someone as small as I am.  (I'm only 5'1\"!) Very high-quality, I think, as ties go.

       "949   I totally didn't have a problem with the seller or anything, great shipping! Um, but, the book kinda rots. If you know how to tie a tie already, then it might be fine, but I don't. The pictures didn't really help, and the wording wasn't concise. One sentence could be interpreted like nine ways!! I practically destroyed one tie, definitely practice with a tie you don't care about or one that doesnt need to be dry-cleaned, cuz they get pretty rumpled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "950   I love this wrap.  Beautiful organza fabric, which I love because it isn't limp and droopy.  Holds a GREAT shape and looks like a million bucks! Just the right length too; doesn't hang too low like I've seen with some lesser quality wraps.\\n\\nShipped protected well in lightweight packaging that saves on shipping charges, yet protects from damage in shipping or outside elements.\\n\\nAn unbelievable price too; I've seen them double, even triple, the price in many retail stores.

       "951   This is one of the best quality aprons I have found.  It is made out of a heavy canvas which doesn't wear out very quickly.

       "953   Negative reviews aside - mostly because they stray from good common sense and any semblance of a sense of humor - this s a pretty eye-catching bracelet. It has been a conversation starter, but mostly it has been a way for me to say something about myself in a rather innocuous way.\\n\\nI recently broke one that was given to me by a friend. I wore it daily and liked the sentiment. If you can't enjoy life - why bother living it? Then again - if you aren't enjoying life, are you really living? \"LiveWrong\" doesn't take anything away from the good work that many are doing - nor does it fall into the category of all the pseudo-charities who are jumping on the band wagon. It is what it is - a funny idea that has probably given the guy who came up with it a fairly good side income.\\n\\nGood for him.\\n\\nI will be replacing mine - as well as buying a few for friends.\\n\\nWhat's amazing is how few books have review sections this long. Perhaps two words is simply easier for most people to digest and have an opinion about                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "959   I'm 12 years old, and I wear Hanes briefs all the time, every day, and I've never worn anything else before except for a pair of boxers one time that I really hated. Well, I have a bad story to tell. The other day at school, me and my friend were changing in the lockeroom after PE. Well, while I had my pants off, I was only wearing a shirt and my tighty-whities, and while that was the only thing I was wearing, this other boy came up to me, grabbed the waistband of my underwear, and then gave me a super wedgie. What's good about it is that it didn't hurt because wedgies in briefs never hurt. If you wear boxers and you get a wedgie in them, it's gonna hurt bad. Seriously boys, you should try these Hanes white briefs out. They're great in all ways                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "965   I have to say that I was disappointed when I opened up the package containing my iPod wallet. It's cute, but not $60ish cute. First of all, it's not leather, it's nylon. The lining is indeed suede, but the photos in the product listing are misleading. I'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back, etc. isn't worth it. It does the job, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I feel ripped off                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "970   This isn't a review of this product, so much as it's a review of the impression it makes.  Anyone who was in Paris around the turn of the century will remember Aubade's \"Lecons de Seduction\" advertising campaign, of which the image shown here for this \"tanga\" was a part.  Each item of lingerie featured in the ads featured a little piece of advice to the wearer as to how she could use this item to make the right sort of  impression ... and isn't that just what frilly little underthings like this are for?  Nothing has made a stronger impression on us                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "986   Champion socks have been my favorite socks for about 10 years now!  I refuse to use any other socks.  As for the previous review regarding cutting off circulation and leaving marks on your legs, this shouldn't be a problem so long as you don't have massively obese legs.  I would suggest the reviewer try losing some weight before knocking on these socks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "989   I ordered this yoga pant in black. The item I received has a very large split up the outside of each leg which is not shown in the pictures of the item and is not mentioned in the product description. The item appears so different in person that I could only assume I was sent the wrong item. The seller Athletic allows returns on merchandise but will not refund shipping charges. When I contacted the seller Athletica to say I didn't think I should have to bear the cost of shipping to me ($7.75) and then return shipping to them for their error in either shipping the wrong item or not appropriately portraying the product, they refused to do anything about the shipping costs and they tried to blame Amazon for the picture on the website rather than accepting any responsibility. I will not order from this seller again, and I would caution others against doing so either                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "990   I don't think I have ever gotten anything shipped to me so quickly! I do almost all my shopping online, and was totally shocked to see the package from Amazon as soon as I did!

       "991   I went by the size guide on their website, but upon receiving it, I wish I had gotten a size smaller... it was a bit too loose in some areas. Also, you need the kind with the straps around the bra, because without it, this thing inches its way down like they are all prone to doing. Other than that, this does smooth out problem areas quite well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "997   I realize anyone admitting to wearing a 3X is in trouble in the conservation of fabric, but this manutacturer must be very generous.   The garment was SO LARGE I could have made two out of the one unit.  This certainly was an error in sizing or I am smaller than I thought.

       "1001  This is one of the best thongs I've found.  The back is not too thick as to be bunchy and not to thin as to cut into you.  The pouch is cut a little large, which is a positive--you won't feel like you're \"popping out\".  The cotton/lycra blend just feels great, too.

       "1005  i got the largest size they had (size 10) and my toes were crunched in. they fit my mom just barely, and she's a size 8. i wanted to get my money back for it, but it'd probably be more money just to ship the incredibly small slippers back, then it actually costed to begin with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

Same footbed and sole, however, the strap is now one piece and conforms to the top of the foot much better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "1009  I could not wait to get this bag.  When I did I found out that it was not all that it was in for. I have to walk home and it really hurts my back.  Plus, it does not hold much.  I had the problem of having to much books. This does not help. It was a waste of $40. Plus, how do you clean it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "1017  I ordered this robe for my son on Monday, the day he was to be released from the hospital following surgery.  To my surprise, it was delivered the next day, beautifully packaged and accompanied by a hand-written thank you note.  The quality and workmanship of the robe are outstanding, and having the terrycloth on the inside works well under the circumstances, as does the lighter weight.  It is a substantial robe, but not as heavy as velour, for instance.  I laundered the robe before giving it to my son, and it came out of the dryer looking as perfect as when it went in - not a thread out of place and no distortion.\\nI'm very pleased with the product, the value, and the service, and look forward to becoming a return customer.  Oh, yes...my son loves the robe, too                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "1029  Looking at the photos I wasn't sure about its quality, but as I was looking for a camo tee with long sleeves and couldn't find any other I decided to risk it. And I LOVE it. It's thin and clingy, but very soft and comfortable. It looks and *feels* great. \\n\\nI wasn't happy with some others things I ordered from Andrew Christian (mostly belts - cheap looking!, and gloves), but this tee is a ten. I would buy it again, and I probably should, seeing how I like to wear the one I have now                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1040  This is a lovely fat scarf that looks like it was hand-knitted from scraps, just like I used to do before I got bored with knitting. It's squishy and warm and the perfect combination of colors for me; I just cut off the tag and people think I made it myself.

       "1041  This strap is thinner than those used in yoga classes.  It is sharp on the arch when held there for poses.  I would not purchase another one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "1046  I agree--these DO run large. The 7 runs more like a 7.5 to 8, so try before you cut the tags or wear outside. The Primas are lightweight and stylish enough to wear while running after the kids, running errands around town or walking the dog. Would give 5 stars if the sizing was more accurate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1047  I love this dress.  It's adorable, not too short (I'm 5 7 and everything is too short) and looks great with leggings.  It's very deconstructed- but that is OBVIOUS from the picture.  I wore it over a tank and w/ leggings- it was very cute and not too over the top 80s for someone who has worn the stuff the first time around.  Also- the seller is great- fast shipping for a small company- and very customer oriented- they have great response time from a REAL PERSON- not an automated system- almost unheard of in online shopping!

       "1056  I have been enjoying this product for years. I had weight loss surgery 5 years ago and used it when I first had surgery. It helped with protecting the incision and my self confidence (from the sagging skin). Now 5 years later I find myself using it again because I've opted out of plastic surgery (at least for now) and I do enjoy how shapely it makes me look.\\n\\nOnly complaints are - it tends to roll up at the bottom (if you tend to be more pear-shaped) and sometimes the fasteners show through your blouse (if you wear clingy material). But besides that - I love it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

I emailed the customer service team at cover case with hopes to return the item, but they told me instead they would send me the screen protection and never did.  After waiting 2 weeks, I emailed back the costumer service and asked that they either send the screen protection or directions on how to send the item back.  It has now been a month and they have failed to correspond, so I decided to just deal with the fact I spent money on a case that didn't have what I wanted.  I've been using it, and the rest of it is ok, although, the silicone fits weird on the top and sometimes it bunches up, making it hard to toggle the hold switch.  I'll probably by a new, better case soon. Oh well                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "1061  Color: We ordered 2 bathrobes, one Espresso and one Chino colored.  The Espresso is a very dark brown, and the Chino is a beautiful natural cream color.  Of the two colors, we both prefer the Chino color.  (The dark brown is slightly more of a cooler toned brown, than a warm brown tone.)\\n\\nQuality:  The robes are very soft, medium thickness and fluffy.   The stiching is well done.  Nice tag inside stating made in Turkey.  \\n\\nPackaging:  Arrived in a plastic zipped bagged, nicely folded.\\n\\nSize:  We are both a normal weight range 5' 6\".  These are a one-size fits all robe, so,  as always, they are bit large, but we both like them that way.   The sleeves reach to my knuckles, but the stitching is such that the robes look finished even with the cuffs folded back.   \\n\\nContent:  These are looped 100% cotton, just what we wanted.  We were searching for 100% cotton bathrobes that we could use in winter to get to/from our hot tub.  (Polyester bathrobes don't absorb water and you end up wrapped but cold.)  \\n\\nCompany:  We ordered these near the holidays and the company included a hand-written holiday card signed by a few of the staff thanking us for ordering.

       "1067  the silicon case and lcd protector make for a good combination.  as another reviewer mentioned, the case actually makes it easier to use the buttons around the navigation wheel.  the armband is a little too snug for my arm, which isn't really all that big and manly.  i haven't figured out the belt clip yet, but i was pleased to see that it was black (same as my case) rather than the white clip pictured.  i didn't give it 5 stars because of the smallish armband and flimsy belt clip, though it's still worth getting just for the case and screen protector                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "1069  I bought my fair skinned, red-headed husband one of the these shirts to have for a cruise to Mexico. He wore it snorkeling, swimming and SCUBA diving.  He loved it! It protected him from the sun. It dried quickly and looked good in and out of the water. It isn't as tight as the rash protection shirts so it wears more like a t-shirt but my husband preferred the more loose fit. The fabric is perfect for water. He even wore it on our cruise ship to dine at the buffet table after a swim since it looked so good. We liked it so much, we bought one for my father who also has fair skin. He said it was his favorite gift. If you need sun protection but still want to be active in water and sun, this is a great shirt to have.  You do have to hand wash it and hang to dry but I just soak it in cool water with Tide then rinse and hang. It's a snap. We're avid swimmers, SCUBA divers and snorkelers.

       "1073  I bought the iskin duo about a month & a half ago & as soon as I got it I knew there would be a problem.  The screen protector & the click wheel cover are separate pieces & don't stay in place very well.  I ended up taking the click wheel cover off (still covered by a layer of silicone) and that seemed to work much better.  The surface was quick to collect lint right away and for the price you pay for it makes you wonder why it's made so cheaply.  I just got this skin a few days ago.  It comes with a clear cover to put over the face before you put the skin on.  The lanyard they include with it looks a little chintzy but other than that I have no complaints!  I like it so much I'm going to order another one!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1076  Great product. I got exactly what I wanted. I would give it 5 stars, but they didn't have the dark brown you see in the picture. Instead I got a Khaki color. I was very happy with their service and prompt reply. Just make sure they have the color you want.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "1080  These gloves are great for cool areas in the home or at work.  I use them while I am sitting reading a book or working on the computer when I am in the basement.  My hands stay warm and I can still do activities without having my fingers covered up.  I even gave a pair to a friend who always had cold hands but had to work with paperwork                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "1084  This is a very nice quality shirt for the price.  It runs large through the shoulders and neck area. Other than that, I think it is a great, comfy shirt. It may shrink after washing, which is what I am hoping because I do like the shirt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "1086  I bought this mat because it's not boring and I wanted something to inspire me to actually use it. I ordered Amethyst and it's beautiful! It's very sticky and I don't slip at all. It is definitely a 5 star yoga mat but I have to say very thin even though I know this is the standard for yoga mats at 1/8\". On top of my hardwood floors, it still hurts the small of my back to do simple poses. I am 23 and petite and I should have ordered a thicker mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "1092  This bodysuit is very HOT.  It's comfortable and very flattering to my size 12 figure.  The openings give the ease of not having to unbutton, untie or take anything off. It will make you feel just a little naughty, and incredibly sexy.  I was very pleased with my husbands response when I tried it on for him.  I've never bought anything like it before.  I highly recommend it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1094  This sandal is nice. It takes a bit of getting used to since you dont typically have things poking into the bottom of your feet. Wear a sock and after you are used to the sandal, it will actually feel pretty comfortable. Excellent sandals to bring to the swimming pool. Quality is good. I gave it 4 since it is not the best design to adapt to, but the quality is superb                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "1095  Based on the several good reviews below, I decided to purchase this dress to wear for my own wedding.  There is a review that said the dress comes in larger than expected so I ordered a size small.  The shipping is very fast.  I ordered on a Thursday evening and received the dress on Monday (I do live in the same state where the company is in).  However, the dress is too tight.  I'm 5 ft 4 inches, weigh 120 lbs., and I usually wear a women's size 2 (i.e., Banana Republic, Express).  I will be exchanging the item for a medium.  For the price, the dress is a good bargain.  It is sheer on the bottom, so you will need a slip underneath.  The beading is nice (extra beads are included) and the way the dress flares out at the bottom is very unique.  The dress was long on me, and would probably need to be taken in at least 3 inches.  The clasp are loosely sewn on (two broke after I took off the dress), so I would have a seamstress sew it on more tightly.  The dress also arrives folded, so you will need to take care of the wrinkles.  Overall, I'm happy with the dress for its price and design and I can't wait to receive the correct size                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1105  This bag was not what I expected.  The leather was cheap and it wasn't really big enough to fit much.

       "1108  I bought 10 of these tags because I travel almost every week. I got the leather tags with the cover up flap. I was tired of having mismatched tags that I had scraped up from anywhere and everywhere. I was also looking for a tag that kept my personal information covered up from strangers standing nearby. Another thing I was looking for was a tag that was strong. It was not uncommon for me to pick up my luggage in the airport to discover my tag had been ripped off. Sometimes part of it was left. Sometimes all of it was gone. Luggage and their tags take a lot of abuse.\\n\\nOK about this product...They are real leather. They are nice looking. There are two reasons why I am giving this product a 4 instead of a 5 rating. First the leather is a little on the thin side. It would be a nice thickness to make a ladies purse or a fine wallet for a businessman in a suit but...a luggage tag? Like I said, these tags need to be virtually indestructable to survive. I am a little dubious that the thin leather strap will really hold up. I may be wrong...this is only my speculation at this point. The second thing is the price. It seems to me that this product should be in the 3 to 4 dollar, each, price range instead of the 5 to 6 dollar range.\\n\\nThere are different colors available which is good (I bought green) because nowadays 95% of all the bags coming down the conveyor are BLACK. Everyone needs something on the outside of their bag to help make it easily identifiable. These colored tags do that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "1112  The robe is very warm and heavy, perfect for cold mornings and the \"just out of the shower chills\" that you get. It doesnt quite have the \"luxurious\" feel of a spa robe, and the thread loops are matted in certain areas, but quality wise it is better than anything else I've seen for similar prices. The length is much shorter than pictured. I bought this for my boyfriend, who is 6 ft, 190 lbs, average build, and it comes just above his knee! All in all, it's a decent robe for the price and he likes it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1117  I ordered this bag and received it VERY fast. In fact, that's probably why the shipping costs brings the total out to $25. I wouldn't even bother with expedited shipping of any sort because you're already going to receive your item with 1-2 days of ordering.\\n\\nAs for the quality of the bag, considering the price before shipping, it's very nice. It's much blacker than the photo shows, and it's not too big or too small. \\nI don't know what the reviewer that stated it wouldn't last does with his messenger bags, but there's no reason for this bag to not withstand a college student's use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1125  We have a big smiling rubber rat in the state store where I work, but he isn't nearly as menacing as this sucker! In fact's he's kinda friendly. This guy's a beast...blood red eyes, sharp claws, looks like he'd take your throat if you slipped and fell in the bathroom. No ordinary broom neccesary here, friends, no, what you need is a can of mase and a nightstick. Buy this guy, set him in the windows of a dark room, and call the cops. God knows they need some useful stuff to do at night besides drink coffee and play video games.

       "1141  It would help to know the dimensions of this bag.  It is very sharp looking, but can it hold one or two 16 fl. oz. bottles of water upright? It would be helpful to be able to click on it and have a picture of the inside pop up as well, along with the dimensions.  Thanks!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "1144  If you really follow the direction how to wash it then should not be a question. I promptly remove it from the dryer or hang dry.

       "1150  Appears to be good quality. At first I had a difficult time pushing the buttons through the leather - but now it works fine - just needed to \"break it in\".  \\n\\nA little difficult to plug in the charger while in this case - i just turn the player upside down and slide it back in the case when I'm  charging/connecting to my computer. Not a big deal, because you don't need to use the buttons while charging                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1156  What can I say. Snug, warm and very cuddly. The truth is that it is fun to be grren (or to sit halfway down the stairs, or whatever). This T-shirt sports vibrant colors, firm stitching and is just all-round fun. Sizes run a little small - so plan ahead                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "1157  All I have had with this product is problems. the clip in the middle, kept popping open, even when it the wallet was close and my money would fall out, so i ended up removing the cheap clip and useing it for what ever. don't waste your money                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "1160  This Jacket fits very nicely. It is impressively waterproof, while still is breathable. It is fairly warm, which makes it good for colder weather but not so good as a casual jacket. The only major flaw is the fount outside pockets have zippers around the openings so when you take your hands in or out of them it scrapes against you, which is discouraging enough to inhibit the use of those pockets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1164  I really like my Ameribag. It is much smaller than my last purse, but it holds everything the old bag did. What's more, it feels so much lighter! It has a compartment for everything and the compartments are a silver/grey color which makes it so much easier to see something that is in my purse. This bag is well worth it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1166  My husband is a cyclist.  This is a terrific way to carry essentials such as ID, credit cards or cash.  He no longer has to worry about forgetting these things in his bike pack.  He absolutely loves it!  He also has the Nike/Nano monitor & uses the wallet for it as well!  \\nThe seller I purchased this from was EXTREMELY nice & helpful.  I would gladly purchase from them again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1171  This set is perfect for that weekend getaway or valentines or anniversary or.....   No it's not a $25-$50 set, but that's not how they sell it.  You could have 3 different colors and sets for that price. Anyhow, they've served their purpose!

       "1175  I recently purchased a small AmeriBag Healthy Back Bag in anticipation of a long summer trek through Europe.  I didn't think my backpack would be secure from pickpocketers, and I wanted something a little more \"grown up.\"  Here are some reasons I am very happy with this purchase:\\n\\n1) Comfort.  My Healthy Back Bag is more comfortable than either a backpack or a large purse.  Its wide strap sets securely on my shoulder without a hand on it, and it adjusts easily so I can carry it across my chest.  You can put a lot in it and not feel the weight - you will not end up with your shoulder in knots at the end of the day.\\n\\n2) Security.  The zippered compartment openings fit neatly beneath my armpit; there are interior zipper pockets as well, so it's pretty hard to imagine someone's hand slipping into the bag without my knowing it.  The wide strap is reinforced so it would be hard to cut.\\n\\n3) Convenience.  This bag has supremely well-designed features.  On the outside, there is a flat zipper pocket (good for your subway pass) and a separate velcro pocket on one side, a velcro pocket with a flap on the other, and a small pocket suitable for (say) sunglass on the end. The main zipped compartment has a wide variety of open pockets (for perhaps a pen, a camera, a PDA or Ipod), including one conveniently placed sidways so you can easily get at it from when it's still on your shoulder.  That one is perfect for a cellphone.  There is a flat inside zipper pocket that serves me well as a wallet.\\n\\n4) Capacity.  I've got the small version of the bag, and it will still hold a wide variety of daily essentials: wallet, phone, camera, ipod, a paperback, a compact umbrella, and even perhaps a very light sweater.\\n\\nThe biggest problem with these bags is figuring out which one you want - err on the small side (they are more comfortable), then choose whatever fabric and color suits your fancy.  You can even get them in a premium leather, but my microfibre one seems easy to clean and a good value.\\n\\nThis is my favorite bag - I can easily see several decades in my future with a Healthy Back Bag under my arm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "1176  I purchased one of these shirts to see what the quality was compared to the price. As soon as I received it and wore it twice I went back and purchased three more. The weave on these shirts is thick making the shirt very comfortable to use and I suspect will give it a long life. After multiple (10+) washings, the first one I purchased still feels as good as the newer ones. The colors are warm. I would suspect that this shirt would cost $10-15. As long as the price stays below $10, I will continue to purchase these as all-purpose daily-wear/work-out tshirt.\\n\\nAs for the comment that these fit smaller than most, I didn't have that experience. In Nike, Reebok, Gap, and Rusell Athletic tshirts, I wear a large. I wear a large in Artiga as well, and the fit is comparable to those brands with no noticeable shrinkage after washing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "1178  the swim suit was so unsatisfactory looking that I didn't even try it on.  it was blue striped with a totally different blue strap that didn't go with the main color of the suit.  Very poor choice for a grab bag.  Taught me not to use grab bag shopping from this company                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1179  the 2 bras i ordered were they same style, it even said so on the labels attached, however, they both look and feel different.  the white has a lot more padding, a rounder shape, and the lining is tearing away from the padding (part of the design).  The navy bra had a more pointed shape and less padding (which is what I wanted in the first place) I was also disappointed in the sparse stock that was on had...in addition, I had to wait an extra 2 weeks for one of the bras to come in because in the ordering screen I was not informed that it would have to be backordered.  not happy with my overall experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "1184  I have to tell you folks, if you are looking for a sweatshirt/hoodie type of clothing, this is it.  The hoodie came with a place for my head and arms and the name hoodie is not a misnomer.  It had a fully functional and attached hood.  Studies show that we lose 70% of our body heat via our heads.  Well just put the hood up and you can keep all that heat.  Yes, with this hood you too can do your part to stem the tide of global warming.  If the hood is too big, well there are strings that are included that will allow you to close down the hood good and tight.  In fact you can go overboard and be your group of friends very own Kenny.  Mumble away in the warmth of a Russell Althletic Men's Logo Sweatshirt.  This pack also came with a t-shirt that had many of the same features as the sweatshirt.  It is a great way to show off your support for your favorite sports team or the sports team your state has made the \"only\" college that is acceptable to root for.  Typically this is done by placing an ever pretentious \"The\" in front of the name of the university.  You also need to over emphasize the \"The\" as well.  But enough about that.  You, go buy this product!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "1186  The rubber does not go around the screen, and is generally poorly designed. The bit of sticky backed plastic thet supply to go onto the screen leaves bubbles of air on the screen. I shall now be ordering the official Apple one in the hope that that is a lot better than this thing. Hope that helps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1187  Well, after using my Creative Zen naked, with no covering at all; with the other popular leather cover; and with this sillicon cover/package, I can honestly say that, considering the price and what's included in this package, this is, by far, the best route to go when picking a case for your own Zen. \\n\\nThe other main case, the leather one, looks nice, but for around $30, I expect a little more functionality. This cover is a few dollars cheaper, and for that, I would only expect a cover, as is included with the leather one. But, when you take into account the screen protector that's included (and which costs $15 by itself from other places), the stand on the back (which is, granted, mildly weak, but look at what it's holding up....if you watch your share of videos and movies on your Zen, as I do, the back-stand comes in very handy), and the other things, I would expect it to be more. So, don't let the cheap price deter you from getting this one, as it almost did me, thinking that it's poor quality. The sillicon tends to attract dust and lint, but it wipes or blows away easily, and is, really, the only thing that comes close to a downside. \\n\\nGet this case. You won't regret it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "1198  I love this iPod case. It looks really good with my green mini. I also like that you can use the belt clip with the case on. The cut outs are pretty much where they need to be though sometimes they are a little off. I also like how tight it fits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1201  I bought this for travel, but have ended up using it virtually everyday while at home.  Its great for curling up on the couch and keeping your feet snuggly warm.  The design is so creative with a foot pocket and separate shoulder wrap--I haven't seen anything like it.  I've been giving it as gifts to family members and it gets rave reviews from everyone--travellers and couch potatoes alike!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

We've got a Svan high chair (the best!) that has a pretty small opening for the kid's torso, so a stiff bib that you are constantly stuffing in there is such a pain.  Also, when cleaning, if you got the back (fabric) side of the bib wet, the bib would be cold and wet for hours.  The bumkins bibs can be washed thorougly with soap and water in the sink and then hung up.  They will be totally dry by the next meal!  They are so soft that our daugher doesn't mind wearing them.  They do not get in the way and stay nicely tucked (assuming our daughter doesn't pull the bib up to look for \"bib goodies\" in the pocket).  We bought 2 sets and could easily use more.  They can also be washed in the washing machine (no dryer but they air dry super fast)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "1214  This sheet is great solution for difficult to change crib sheets- just lay it over the top of your pretty sheet and snap it to the crib frame.

This is the first day I have worn it and I am already online to purchase more!!  The price of $... is almost unheard of for such a quality garment.

       "1220  \"Classic\" sweatpants have elastics around the ankle to keep out of your way for biking, (and now \"spinning\"?)  I hate this new style where the manufacturer saves money by imitating fashion jeans, leaving the elastics out and letting the ankle cuff drag on the floor. Dangerous for working out, and certainly not \"classic!\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "1221  I bought this back when it was on sale when I was still an employee at Sears and I was definately not dissapointed.  Being a 3-in-1 jacket has several uses. First off, the jacket worn with both the fleece inner lining and the outer shell is very warm for use outside on frigid winter days and the shell semeed to be waterproof or water resistant because even after rolling around in the snow it wasn't drenched. The outer shell by itself provides some warmth and also the water resistant outside to put over something else, say for example the suit jacket I wore to work. Definately not for winter use by itself but a nice compliment to something else. The fleece on its own is what I liked. Very warm and comfortable and stylish looks, I would constantly wear it around town by itself on a cool fall evening when out with friends. Only downside, it seems to be a magnet for pet hair.\\n\\n\\nALl in all, very satisfied with my jacket. Starting to get a bit small now so I'll definately buy a larger version and sell the old one                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "1230  this bag is awesome.  it's not big enough to use as a suitcase, but for women, carrying a laptop bag and a purse can be a hassle.  this eliminates that problem because it fits your laptop and anything else you could feasibly need to carry with you!  i just put my purse right in there.  the only problem is that i have a 15\" laptop, which fits in the bag, but the velcro strap that holds the laptop in place barely fits over it.  it does though, but it would be good if that were a little longer to hold it more securely.  also, for those with a laptop bigger than 15\" this bag is not for you.  i also love the outer pocket... perfect for your boarding pass and other travel documents you may have to access several times and quickly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "1233  I'm a meeting planner and travel quite a bit with my job. I also have a lot of things I have to carry on rather than check. As an example, on a recent trip I was able to pack two laptops and two 1\" 3-ring binders, along with my makeup bag and a few other small necessities.\\n\\nThe bag is made of sturdy fabric and the wheels roll smoothly. The telescoping handle pops up and collapses quickly & effortlessly. The bag also comes with a detachable shoulder strap which I removed because (1) my bag is always too heavy to carry on my shoulder and (2) when rolling, the shoulder strap often dragged on the airport floor which caused it to get dusty & dirty. Fortunately, this bag has two short handles which make it easy to lift when going up stairs or moving it to an overhead bin.\\n\\nI highly recommend this bag and at this new sale price I'm thinking about getting one for my personal laptop too                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1241  I couldn't find this product in stock in my local store, so I was glad to find it online.  I can't get my cup size in ample-enough width, so this really helped to get my bra from cutting into my back.  It's a great value, too; you can even use more than one if you need to.  Even though I didn't like needing to pay shipping and buy so many (3 or 4) at once, they are good,  durable, quality products.  Just be careful doing the wash so you don't lose them! I couldn't find these at a major maternity store (not the specific one I needed), and my local nursing store was sold out-- which was too bad, but I needed good support late in pregnancy and post-partum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1242  I bought this case for my Creative Zen about a week and a half ago. When it got here, it was very easy to put on my Creative Zen.It's very stretchy! It protects it really well too. It's a great deal! If you have a Creative Zen and want an inexpensive but good case, this is made for you! The belt clip is awesome too. It swivels around so you can still look at it even if it's on your belt. 5 stars                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1245  Well made, quite lightweight, but just the perfect thing for summer when you want to keep a breeze off you, or are going somewhere air-conditioned.  Would be good doubled over in the winter under a coat, too.  #k112 by the same maker is essentially the same piece in a very yellow green color with black trim; it's very pretty too, if you like that color. I'd get it again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "1248  At first I had my heart set on a different cloak, but when it was no longer available I decided to go with this one. I am very pleased that I was not disappointed. This cloak looks and feels beautiful. It has a nice button closure at the neck, and for those that are petite it is floor length. This cloak is just what I was looking for to add a last minute touch to my Halloween costume. It is very comfortable and soft, no itchy feel here                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1254  The \"leather\" or whatever this is that the belt is made of smells so bad and strong, my whole closet ended up with a foul odor.

       "1256  I ordered this in a black and am extremely happy with it. It is well made and very silky. It feel wonderful against the skin. The stretch bodice was a little stiff but that was just the sizing and goes away after the first washing. I love the way the generous skirt swirls around my legs. Very sexy. I am going to get another one in another color!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1257  Everything was OK. It would have been great if the turn off switch worked. I have to take the batteries out when I'm not using it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "1262  I recieved this today and right out of the bag there was a small hole near the shoulder.  The material looks very cheap.  In addition, this is not a cardigan type sweater where you can open and close in the front.  The front closure is made up of a string that loops the two side together like your shoe laces.  To put it on you have to pull it on like a pullover                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1263  I brought home an Italia jersey from Italy for my Polish husband's birthday recently, not figuring that the European sizes are smaller. When the Italia jersey was too snug, I found this Polish Postal Team jersey and ordered it a size larger (as the site recommends) and it arrived today(2 days later-love it!) My husband is really happy with it. By ordering a size larger than his normal size, it fit perfectly! The jersey is very light weight, great for Tennessee summers, and zippers almost all the way down the front, another nice touch when it's warm. It has 3 large pockets in back to hold \"stuff\". I would highly recommend this jersery as my husband came back from his ride raving about how confortable and cool it was. And, the graphics are really nice, too                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "1267  This workout is short but you will feel \"worked out\" when done.  Tina cues well and the workout flows very smoothly.  No awkward transitions.  The ball is used for both total body toning and 4 limb cardio.  Your core and abs get a great workout too with both traditional and functional moves.  I enjoyed the change of using the ball instead of dumbells.

       "1268  I bought this hat because it was one of the cheaper, more attractive cowboy hats I'd seen. It's the perfect weight and shape and it fits my head without feeling like it's too tight or like my head'll drown in it. My sister liked it so much I got her one too. She works at a summer camp and she told me whenever she wears it people ask where she got it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1281  Now, I'm a pretty picky guy when it comes to certain things in life and one of those items just happens to be Backpacks. I spent about two months searching for a new one until I finally came across this particular model. I'll start with by saying that I love this damn thing. It has plenty of space, a whole bunch of extra cords that I suppose a hiker would use but I think just look nice, and its very durable (which is a must for me since everything I own will take a beating). I'm telling you straight from the horse's mouth, this Backpack is worth the money. Now if it only came as an 18 slot..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1284  I followed the advice of the other reviewers and bought big.  For me, the 1X is a bit too big, even though I often buy that size since I do not like tight jackets.  \\n\\nThe blue color is beautiful, though, and the craftsmanship is good.  If it goes back down to $19.xx, and you are on the fence, I would definitely go for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1290  I bought this as a complement to a dress for a late summer wedding.  Well, it goes with a lot more -- from jeans to dress up.\\n\\nI see a lot of Indian style purses, but I've never seen one like this.  It is quite practical, too, by having a long strap to leave your hands free.\\n\\nWell done                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "1291  The Charles David strike high heel sling is stylish and sophisticated.  It's an update of a classic that will never go in the back of the closet.  The fit is true to size and is surprisingly comfortable.  I intend to wear this for work and for going out.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1294  Okay so I've been a competitive swimmer for quite over a decade, and my family and I bought several Ugg boots....probably a decade ago.... before they became the trend that it is now.  Simply put, I love them.  If you want your feet cozy and warm and happy, then you can't go wrong buying this.  I have this style and two different others, but speaking specifically of this Ugg slipper style, it's the best thing to wear around the house.  You can put on right after you get up in the morning and take off right before bed or if you need shoes to get something in the cold garage or just because the kitchen floor is too cold that socks aren't enough.  I've worn mine so much the cushion/lining inside is worn almost bare, but remember I've had mine for so many years.  That's right, they last you that long, and it still offers more warmth than most slippers do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1297  Unfortunately, my experience with this product is less than stellar.  For one, I am a very hairy man.  A VERY HAIRY MAN.  The look was completely different from the picture.  Secondly, upon closer inspection of the product pictured, it appears that the model has a SOCK stuffed in the front!  That must be what they mean by super sock.  Anyway, when I crammed my package in there, it looked a prairie dog popping up out of its hole.

       "1301  I realize this isn't an expensive bra, but I expected it to at least FIT! I've never ordered a bra that was sized this crazy! The band was way too big and the cups were way too small.

The roll provides a lot of tape so it will last a long time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1311  This jacket is soft and almost luxurious.  I am greatly disappointed that when hanging the hoodie by the hood, it split and tore under its own weight!!!!  I think this says it all, no?  I would, unfortunately, not buy and American Apparel item again.  They are usually sized WAY too small and now I see the quality just isn't there.  Greener pastures.....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "1333  I am so glad to be able to buy a parka like the one I bought years ago when these coats were more popular.  That one was wearing out badly and I was concerned that I would not be able to get one like it again as you just can't find them anymore in the retail stores.  (It seems that being warm/smart isn't \"cool\" or in fashion anymore) The hoods on these kind of coats are excellent for cold windy winter days.  I tried a few of the military outlet places and wasn't satisfied with their quality.  I was so pleasantly surprised to find this parka for less than the military outlet stores!  The only thing it lacks is a inside lapel pocket, but I guess I can learn to live without that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "1343  Perhaps it is my own fault for not reading more closely, or failing to question the somewhat ambiguous product description.  The fact is, I thought that I would be receiving 84 plastic stays (3x28), 28 each in 3 different sizes.  At $8.00, that seemed like a reasonable deal for plastic collar stays.  What I got, and I confess that the product description could be interpreted this way, was a total of 28 stays in assorted sizes.  When you add in the $4.00 I was charged for shipping (actual US Postal Service postage on the package was $1.84), this really is a poor deal compared to other available options.  About 43 cents for each plastic collar stay?

       "1344  I previously used one of those \"carabiner\" type keychains because I liked being able to easily remove multiple keyrings as needed.  However, I had problems with keyrings occasionally falling off of it when the clasp somehow was activated.  Enter the Snaplink, a low-tech-form-meets-function solution.  \\n\\nIt's more secure than the carabiner, though a bit more work to remove a ring, kind of like unlatching your belt.  The leather is absolutely beautiful and clearly very high quality.

She won't wear any of her other socks now                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "1352  Very disappointing!  I ordered STRETCH jeans.  I paid postage to get them here only to find out they are not STRETCH jeans.  I called cust. service.  He spent enough time with me and another department to find out that these jeans must be mismarked and if he (Bealls cust.serv.) sent me another pair I would get the same thing.  In order to get money back I had to return the item.  Now I've paid postage again! and Yes I did receive the $12.99 credit for the jeans, but what about the postage?  This was not my fault!  The item was INCORRECT!!  Your Return Policy indicates that yo uWILL pay the postage, so if you need to see a copy (which I also put in the return box) of what I ordered, please feel free to contact me.  I printed it out so I can fax it, scan it & email it, or snail mail it, or however you would like to receive it.  Please return the shipping costs that I paid for a product that apparently mismarked.  thanks, Debbie Pearson P.S.  I see the title description has been corrected to show that these ARE NOT stretch jeans -- wish I would have known so that I would not have to be writing this review.  If no satisfaction is given there will be no more purchases via amazon, but especially not Bealls                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "1354  The quality is just excellent on this product.  I am very picky about the wallet so it could be improved if the money clip was a different style and held the bills on the inside.  If you are used to a money clip but want room for credit cards and ID to stay secure, you will love this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "1359  The shawl is very thin, not good quality, I suspect it is not cashmere at all, but some kind of a mixture of cheap wools. The color was supposed to be expresso, not even that promise was fulfilled, it is a much lighter brown. I do not recommend this shawl at all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "1368  At first I was bugged by how sticky this was, but boy did it work! They gave me 1/2 ounce tube in the hospital (and charged me $9 for it, but that's another story!) It moisturizes and protects your nipples from chafing while nursing, and doesn't bother baby a bit. Take my advice, bring your own tube to the hospital to avoid being over-charged!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1372  Want to lose 10 lbs around your midsection without plastic surgery? Buy this immediately! This is truly amazing. You will look and feel better in your clothes (especially low fitting pants and slim knit dresses). A tad tricky to get into (practice or give yourself plenty of time when getting ready). But other than that...this thing is worth its weight in gold. I'm buying at least one more! :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1373  I received this sweatshirt as a gift off of my wish list.  I had asked for a large, thinking it would be a little roomy for me (I normally wear a unisex medium), and discovered that it was not just roomy, but huge!  My husband was swimming in it!  I exchanged the sweatshirt for a small which is still roomy, but by just the right amount.  So they seem to run 2 sizes big.  The exchange took about 2 weeks, 1 week to get there, 1 week back, not too bad.  I love my sweatshirt, so it was worth the wait!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

But I'm using four of the compartments and it's already difficult to close.\\n\\nI would have preferred a two fold wallet and if I find one, Rolf's would  be replaced by it, but only because the required pocket space needed would be cut in half.\\n\\nIt's a great wallet, just too bulky for me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1383  This is an awesome product-so comfortable. I am usually size medium, so my complaint is they fit small(for teenagers) I am in my 40's, so that's not too bad, the large fit me at 133lbs. I have had lots of compliments already, the only other complaint is they are not available to be shipped to Canada. I had to get a friend across the border to receive them for me, good thing we live close to the border                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "1387  This cap was definitely not as cute as the picture. Loose threads on it. Looked cheaply made and this was bought as a gift.  I wouldn't recommend this item.  It definitely cost more than it was worth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1388  Finally I have found a quality brand of swimsuit I can order on line and know it will fit.  I'm a daily swimmer who is long-bodied.  This particular style fit great when it arrived; it arrived quickly within four days; shipping was free; and the lycra material is the most resilient I know given the chlorine bashing my suits get.  Please continue to sell this particular item at a price lower than the sports stores.

       "1392  If you are a small frame person or a short person these will work fine for you. The white is thin and you can see through it so i don't reccomend buying white on this brand. The t-shirts run very small. A size x-large fits both of us very big on most brands but this brand was so tight we could not even get it on so these run very small. They are also short. 29 inches is short for a man's t-shirt. If you are tall, i would not recommend this t-shirt. \\n\\nThe t-shirt is soft, not scratchy and the style is nice. We only had problems with the sizing and of course the white being so thin that it is see through                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "1402  The Scarf arrived with several holes in it. My daughter was very dissappointed, crying and wondering why Santa sent this to her. We ordered well in advance before Christmas but the set arrived too late. We were never notified that there would be a delay in shipping. A few days before Christmas it arrived! It was too late to do anything.

Thanks!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "1424  This bag is so cheap looking I am embarrassed to use it.  When I saw it online it looked identical to a US Luggage bag I bought at TJ Maxx, which was stolen.  So, I was very excited to find what I thought was the same bag on Amazon to replace it.  When I got it, I was shocked at how cheap it looks.  The handles especially are plastic leather and just hideous.  The return policy through eBags is such a hassle that I am just going to keep it and use it for bringing my laptop to and from work, but I will still need to find a better travel laptop bag.  I'm very disappointed.  If you're looking for a professional looking laptop bag, this isn't it.  I should have known better for the price, but like I said, I thought it was the same as the other US Luggage bag I had, which was gorgeous and I loved it.  Oh well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "1471  I usually wear a men's medium waist for athletic shorts (Umbro, Adidas, Nike) and they usually fall just above my knee lengthwise.  Just to be safe I ordered a large.  The shorts barely made it past the midpoint of my thigh and my legs aren't overly long.  The waist fits well but if you're looking for a pair of workout shorts, I'd skip these unless you like to show a lot of leg.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "1475  Maybe, just maybe, someone will buy one of these Stick Up Bulbs and maybe, just maybe, the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out. I thought to myself \"buy another one because maybe this one was defective.\" I bought three more.....every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use. It's a great idea....but a worthless piece of junk. The spare bulb? Useless as well. \\n\\nDon't waste a dollar on this junk.

       "1491  From my perspective, it's the perfect gift for a little girl that wants to be just like mommy. Your daughter won't mess with your purse anymore - she'll be busy with her own.

It fits well but is slightly tight.The color is different and really is a rust color and not a plain brown color.I do like it and would reccomend it as an inexpensive casual sportcoat.Thank you Amazon                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1500  I searched for a long time on the internet and found this bag.  I ordered it and was pleased that it was just as I expected.  It's not too big, but big enough to hold wallet, cell phone, folding umbrella and more.  It weighs practically nothing and the leather is very soft. I would definitely recommend this bag                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1501  Like the other Jocks in this line from Bike, the swimmer style is a total WINNER!  Made from high-quality materials, it is the height of performance and fit.  The smaller waistband allows for greater movement and a less restrictive fit especially if you're doing any kind of cardio exercise like running, biking or on the eliptical machine.  The contoured pouch is made of a blended fabric that allows for maximum moisture absorption and breatheability, while cupping and supporting you.  The leg straps are a comfortable width that don't roll or cut under your cheeks.  My only complaint is that I wish they would come out with a black version like they did with their standard Jock.\\n\\nGet rid of your old Jock and buy a bunch of these - I did!  Of course look around, the jocks here on Amazon seem to be a bit pricy, this $6.95 jock I found at a local sporting goods store for $3.99, or a 2-pack for $7.50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "1512  This is my fourth fanny pack.  It seems better made than most.  In particular, the belt buckle seems of a higher quality than most, and that's been the point of failure of two of my previous packs.  (I wish I could find one with a metal buckle.)\\n\\nThere are two changes I would make to this design.  First, the side pockets are too small because they join the main part of the pack in a single seam.  The front panel of the side pocket needs to join the main front panel of the pack in a second seam maybe 3/8\" farther forward.  This would make the side pockets much larger and more useful.\\n\\nBesides that, I note that there is only a single seam joining the belt to the pack.  Time will tell, but I suspect this may become a failure point.  A second or even third row of stitching here would make me feel more confident.\\n\\nAll that said, it seems like a very good pack -- the zippers and pulls are of high quality, the pockets are all lined, there are plenty of pockets including two security pockets for money and other small valuables -- and I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could -- just not 5 :-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "1519  I read other people's reviews before ordering this little bag. I sniffed it when it arrived and it does have a certain odor to it. After smelling it, I believe it to smell alot like some of the clothes that arrive packaged from overseas etc. I was told at the last clothing store I worked in that the smell is from a spray that is used to kill any insects that like to eat the material used for clothing, purses and the like. I do not find it offensive at all and the smell does disappear overnight.\\n\\nThe bag is adorable and very chic!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1522  I was fortunate to be able to pick up the Chocolate Lab striped Oxford when it was offered in the winter.  There's nothing plain about this Oxford.  I would say classic because of the clean lines and gentle shaping provided by the darts in the back.  An additional benefit generally about all of Bealls' long-sleeve Oxfords is that they are shorter in length than most traditional Oxfords.  Most Oxford shirts are about 27\"-28\" in length in a Misses size (0-20), but Bealls' tend to run about 25\"-26\" depending on your size for proportion.  The advantage is that you do not feel the need to tuck, but you can still tuck if you would like.  Personally, I have never been a fan of tucking shirts into pants or skirts, especially if you want to highlight either.\\n\\nWhoever sews these garments takes great care.  The back darts are aligned perfectly and the button thread is done criss-cross style with a double looping underneath for extra strength.  The actual striping of the shirt is straight.  I've seen with some more expensive shirts where someone either didn't follow the pattern correctly or tried to correct an improper pattern badly.  To me, that makes a tremendous difference whether I will come back for more.\\n\\nI am looking forward to more colors again.  The Chocolate Lab stripe is the only one I own and I've had many ask me where I purchased.  I would love to see all of the colors which are offered in the 3/4 sleeve version with the addition of a Kelly green, Gatsby Yellow (short-sleeve version color) and perhaps even a beautiful Violet.\\n\\nDefinitely try this shirt because I know you will be pleased                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "1527  I ordered this Sunday night, and it was shipped out the next day before 5pm. I got it Friday. It was exactly as the picture online, the color matches well (pink was more pink and less coral than in the picture). The fabric feels wonderful! it's very similar to the \"How to Lose a Guy..\" dress but in my opinion, i like the back/neckline better on this one. The mermaidy tail is gorgeous and the length is perfect (5'10ish with heels). The size also matches well with the chart. All in all, this dress was more perfect than I'd hoped for and I'm very happy with it. It looks/feels very glamourous! The only thing on the downside is that this type of dress isn't lined, so you can sorta picture the outline of belly button and even no-VPL panties                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1531  When I saw the price of this dress, I was very skeptical. But after reading the reviews(thank you everyone), I decided to order it since the company had a great return policy. I am more than pleased!!! I am 5'4\", and usually wear a size 8, so I ordered the large. All that needs to be altered is about 1\" off the length, and under the arms(I am a 34D). I also am having my seamstress bustle the train.

       "1535  I purchased 3 different Embassy purses last December.  None of them were the quality I had hoped for, and none were used as the gifts they were intended for.  In this case, the price should be a clue that the bags are cheaply made and not nearly as nice as they look in the pictures used.

       "1558  These gloves are great to wear if you have arthritis in your wrist, hand, or thumb and are a wonderful support following hand surgery.  Almost all other writst/thumb support devices have seams that press against the tender surgery areas, but these have the seams on the outside of the glove rather than on the inside so tender areas stay protected!  The gloves are machine washable and very easy to use.  Plus they feel great                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1559  I received the night gown, tried it on, and actually hated it.  The built in bra was loose, as was the top and there was just too much fabric up top.  The straps are too wide.  The rest of the gown was okay, although it too seemed too drapey and long.  \\n\\nI sent the gown back 3 weeks ago, now, and have STILL not received a refund.

       "1568  Like some of the other reviewers, I ordered the Illuminator but was sent the Dynamo instead. I ordered the Illuminator because I had seen it in a store and know the quality. I am not at all satisfied with the substitution that I received! With the Illuminator you have the option of turning on one light or all three. When you push the button on the Dynamo it clicks like it should be turning on the light but it takes 3 \"clicks\" to get the light to turn on!! I have never had a problem like this when ordering through Amazon but would recommend looking elsewhere if you are specifically looking for the Illuminator, because that's not what you are going to receive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "1575  Good fit, good price, good quality and good protection.  This kti came with some nice features (kick stand, belt loop, belt clip, arm band).  I plan to purchase a more protective case.  As case fits snugly I can leave this on the unit all the time.  I tend to drop things (cameras, cell phones) as I pull them out of the case.

       "1593  This is truly the first shapewear product that I can comfortably wear all day and not feel like I have to rip it off the moment I get home.  The material is soft not rubbery like other products.  It fits like a second skin but it's breathable.  It feels snug where you need to be like in the tummy area and relaxed where you want it to be like in the waist and crotch areas.

       "1595  This boot is a good casual boot for skirts/dresses but runs a little big in the foot - could size down from a 6 to 5 1/2.  It also has a very narrow calf which was great for me but not for the average or larger sized calf woman.  The boot is cute but wish the toe was less rounded to give it a more fashionable appeal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "1596  I get compliments every time I wear this. I took a chance, because I tend to be a bit plump. As other reviewers noted, the sleeves do run snug. But otherwise it's a great jacket at a great price. The grommets are just so fun.It is fully lined.

       "1598  The other reviewer cautioned that if someone were to purchase these boxers, he would not be successful with the ladies. I am a lady and a rather attractive one at that and I can assure you that a gentleman with such distinguishing taste as to wear He-Man boxers would get more than a passing glance. With the literal, but adorably suggestive \"I Have the Power\" on them, they achieve nostalgic innocense and at the same time a sexiness that can only be achieved by a deep appreciation for all things 80s. How could you possibly look cuter unless you were to actually wear purple furry little underwear over your tights like Adam loved to sport? I have been searching for a pair of He-Man boxers for a very long time now and I will definately be ordering a pair of these for my man's birthday!\\n\\n-Hillary DePiano is the author of the She-Ra Collector's Inventor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

I stitched it up as best I could for my granddaughter rather than return it and pay shipping charges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "1626  The shirt is cool in terms of temperature on a hot day and is stellar in terms of looks.  The striped, turn-up sleeves, which you can adjust are such a nice touch.  The purple shade is more like a blush, but looks beautiful on anyone who likes the pink-purple shades.  It's 100% cotton, strong Oxford cloth and feels \"garment washed.\"  I appreciate the speedy service I got in receiving this item from Bealls, too!  Definitely give this one a try                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1627  Initially I was going to order several items from Andrew Christian, until I saw their shipping prices at checkout.  $2 shipping on EACH $4 tee-shirt was more than excessive, they were going to charge me $20 shipping on a $42 order!  I canceled most of the items, only ordering a belt and a tee.  Shipping was still ~ 50% surcharge.\\n     Received my order yesterday and found that the belt is defective.  The buckle is on backwards (no, it's not reversible...) plus the material of the belt itself is damaged by a frayed hole.  It isn't worth the shipping cost & hassle to send it back, I'll probably just throw it away - but I did learn something.\\n     I will never deal with Andrew Christian again!

       "1641  I ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie. There's there's zero stretch in this, it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big. Since they're short from crotch to waist anyway, it doesn't much matter.\\n\\nThe top fits better, since you adjust it. The cut is still quite poor and, again, there's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders. It's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust. It's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem.\\n\\nIf you're narrow through the hips, shoulders or bust, this combo will probably be a nice fit. If you're curvy, you might want to rethink this. It's a shame since it comes in plus sizes. Maybe I should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit IMO                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1642  These are some really good glasses.  Plenty dark, full mirrored so you won't be caught checkin out all the ladies you walk by.  Shoot, for $18 you can't go wrong.

       "1645  I just recieved my bag and I love it. The bag arrived about 4 days after I ordered it. The bag fit my laptop perfectly. At first I was hesitant since the description states \"fits most 15\" laptops.\" I have a DELL INSPIRON E1505, and it fits just nice. There is still plenty of room for my 5 subject notebook and cell and battery charger/mouse. The material is nylon and the handles are very sturdy. I also like that it zips on the top. The padding inside is also nice. I would definitly recommend this product to someone looking for style (looks more like a purse) and also durability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1651  I just received my tote bag.  It is exactly what I hoped it would be.  The pigment color is soft.  The bag is very strong, well-sewn and roomy.  I like the sturdy handles and the neat snap at the top.  I received this item in 6 days from the order date.

       "1654  I want to start by saying Fred Flare- shipped this product very fast!! And the transaction itself was very smooth. I do however, have extreme problems with the product itself. The product is not leather, its nylon, and it sort of looks cheap? The inside material is sued, but that's only the lining for the base of the wallet. Also, The wallet part is very hard to use. You cant really put too much in the wallet- The credit card slots are a little too snug, and there is no place for my I.D. The wallet included a small \"note book\" but it also doesn't fit in the wallet? I was very excited about this product, but now I feel duped. The pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality, and that it was user friendly, but it's not. I do not recommend this product                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1659  While getting ready for a camping trip this September, I realized that I did not have any warm thermal underware. I have tried the $3.99 Wal-Mart specials of those thin white materials but have never had much success with staying warm. Therefore, I decided to try something different. Reading the reviews for this product, I immediatly bought the crew neck top and the long john bottoms. \\nWow. Warm and Toasty! I even used the top as a regular shirt while trapsing around the snowy mountains. \\nThe only two quibbles I have about this material is one: it smells strange almost like plastic (and I cannot get rid of that smell) and lint balls or whatever you call those balls of material that you need scissors to remove after washing show up everytime the material is cleaned. \\nJust wish they made the bottoms in the female style.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1662  For the cost--I thought--might as well try this gadget--there's no real large financial investment, so if it looks or behaves goofy, i'll just toss it in the trash. So, my husband buttons one end of the Tiedown, slides the Tiedown through the necktie's nametag (with the shorter necktie end tucked in also) and buttons the Tiedown at the other end. I would've bet money on the fact that you could see the edges of this 'cheap' tie holder or that the tie just wouldn't lie right.\\n\\nWell, I was right. The tie crumpled all up and looked goofy--until we moved the Tiedown down one button. Then I had my husband stand up straight, lean forward, lean from side to side......... OMG.... I could not see the Tiedown at all, and the tie was completely well-behaved! We were thrilled with this new gadget! Hubby has worn it for a week--and has not heard one comment from colleagues about the 'unusual' tie holder. Because no one can see it!\\n\\nI do have one suggestion though--they should be sold in packs of three or five--that way if one gets broken by the kids, chewed up by the dog, or lost by dear hubby, then you'll have extras on hand. So, in the meantime, by a few when you order! (I didn't realize at the time of this review that a multi-pack was available).\\n\\nThis is a product that will eventually be sold in high quality retail shops--get them while they're still so CHEAP, because once the designers get a hold of them, they'll crank the price up so high you'll think you're buying a slice of gold instead of plastic!! Trust me, I'm stocking up NOW!\\n\\nBuy 'em. You'll love 'em                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "1664  This is a Sock. They give you two and call it a pair. If you buy it as listed you get six socks or three pairs. They make my feet HAPPY!

       "1666  These silk pajamas, in my opinion, have much higher quality stitching, tailoring details, as well as a heavier weight silk than the closely priced DreamSacks pajamas.  \\n\\nSizing Help:\\n\\nTo help clarify sizing for people (there have been conflicting reviews here), I ordered a Medium but then returned it for a L.  I will probably get some minor alterations, but I don't blame the company for that...everyone is shaped differently.\\n\\nI am 6'0\" and weigh 175.  My suit measurements are a 42\" chest, 34\" sleeves, and 32\" pants inseam.  The Medium body fit but the sleeves and pants were too short.  The Large was the best fit overall, although roomier around the chest than I would prefer.  But if you are my size the Large is your best option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "1677  I was glad to have finally found the right pair of boots, but it didn't last long. Not even 3 weeks after I bought it, it already has deteriorated. Given that I live in Seattle, rain seeped in really easily and the sole pads started breaking. It was like wearing melted cardboard                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1678  We are very happy with the gazebo and will be excited to use this next football season.  \\nUnfortunately, the cover came with some stitching missing and we have not been able to receive any response from Amazon after sending 4 emails.  We do not want to send the entire order back for another because the cost of shipping would be more than the cost to have someone repair the stitching.  We have only asked that our repair cost be covered by the company, but we can not get anyone to respond.  We will never order anything through Amazon again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1679  This case is actually made for fourth generation models and although it is being advertised as being for the fifth, the case is too big for a snug fit. It works, but I didn't spend this money for something that was advertised as being made for the new Ipod.

       "1684  I love the skirt.  It arrived on time and in excellent condition.  I got so many compliments on it when I wore it to a 50's party.  It's staying in my closet in the hopes that I will get to wear it again.  It's felt (fabric) with an elastic waist.

       "1693  Nicely designed and assembled, this backpack is a great buy. Everything works. The leather is good quality - looks like calf. It is comfortable to wear on the back but also has a top strap to carry in one hand. That strap and the part of the armband that adjusts are an ordinary sort of nylon strap. I would have preferred all leather, but for this price (under $30) it is a quibbling point. Inside are places for your wallet, cell, PDA, lipstick, etc. \\n\\nOn a brief shopping sortie, it may carry home all your purchases (of small things) and make you look good while doing it. After all, most people use those cheap nylon backpacks with the garish colors (or black, Yuk!) so you will stand out as having some class.\\n\\nNote that it is best to think of this as the equivalent of a large handbag rather than a backpack large enough for an extended camping trip. Look closely at the description of the dimentions. You don't want to be like another reviewer who 'thought it would be bigger.'\\n\\nI feel I really got my money's worth on this.

       "1697  These slippers are thick, fuzzy, and very warm.  The cuff folds up to keep your ankles as cozy as your toes!

       "1711  I have had these boots for one month, winter in Alaska.  I have been climbing a 1,000 foot elevation trail that is about one mile long.  It is winter, the temperatures range from 5F to 25F and the trail is a mixture of ice and snow with a few knife edge ridges of ice.  I am wearing one pair of medium weight SmartWool socks and no gaters.  To date my feet are always warm and dry in these boots.  Lacing alone has prevented snow from coming into the boots.  The lateral support is excellent and better than I expected.  The fit is excellent and I have no slipping inside the boot (yeah!!!).  For my conditions the soles could be slightly more agressive, but they hold well.  My four pint instep crampons have a tendency to slightly roll to the inside...I think because of the shape of the sole at the instep (so I have ordered a set of six point that add 2 to the heel).  Light weight, but strong and sterdy so far.  Felt completely broke in right out of the box.  Not a hint of any blisters going uphill or down.  I would highly recommend them so far                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "1717  The sole is high-profile and well-cushioned.  However, the top material is a soft and flimsy towel-like material that does not provide any lateral support for the foot.  With any walking pressure to the side (as in turning a corner!) the foot is allowed to slide and \"fall off\" of the sole in a sprain-your-ankle sort of way.  I felt very at-risk when I walked in them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "1731  I'm a 56 year old 200# 6'1 pronator with flat feet and left leg 1/2\" shorter than right leg.  The 991 was my first running show and I wore it out in a little over 6 months at about 500 miles or so or walking/running.The 992 has more cushioning and is holding up better.  The Plastic stuff on the back of the 991 just fell apart.  I still have the 991's for alternate days and wear them on short runs or walks.  The 992's do 4-6 mi comfortabley for me.  They are wider than the 991.  Both are 11 1/2D.  I beef them up with a left heel 1/4\" cork, 1/8\" foam in each shoe, and arch molds with strategically placed felts and a ball pad.  I think the 992 is a better shoe and it is wearing well with a couple hundred miles on it.  I don't have experience with other brands so any suggestions for a pronator with bad knees would be welcome.  I need another pair so I can retire the 991's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1745  The dress was gorgeous when I received it, however, there was a slight defect with the item.  I had planned to wear it on my birthday so there was no time to exchange.

       "1747  You know how it is -- the toddler boys seem to grow faster than the toddler girls and stay in diapers longer (nappies to those of you in europe).

       "1748  Having bought this I am disappointed to say that IT IS NOT 3 RING.  It has the 2 straps as shown in the photo.  It is not \"a snap\" to add pages and alphabetize your collection.  I would buy another  for the rest of our collection if it wasn't for that.  Adding and removing pages is a HUGE hassle.  Given it's size I like the carrying handle and the slots in the inside front cover for putting away discs quickly if you or more likely a lazy child does not want to search through the pages to put it back into its correct slot.  Because of the zip closure you can also keep booklets that will not fit in the sleeves, in the binder without them falling out                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "1753  Budget Jungle Boots Avalible From \"[...]\" - Constant wetness is the main problem in the jungle, with the need for ankle support and protection from sharp sticks and rocks. With rubber soles, these boots keep out water from damp ground while allowing the feet to breath through the canvas uppers. After wading a river, the action of walking squirts water out of special steel vents in the instep. The cleats are wide and deep for good grip on wet ground.

       "1756  This is a great top for my teenage daughter.  It looks great on and she loves it.  It can be layered in cold weather or worn by itself in warm.  My only problem is that I was not offered a choice for expidited shipping which I wanted.

       "1769  I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband, and while I wasn't expecting the best quality in the world (because of the price), I was still a little disappointed. The company did a wonderful job of packaging/shipping the product-even the buttons were individually protected. I paid for expedited shipping, but they still cut the deadline close, so I was nervous about it arriving in time. The lining on the inside is thick and bulky so it isn't as streamlined as the pic implies, and tends to make the leather bulge a bit in places. (It was lumpy-looking even in the box.) Removing the zip-out lining doesn't change this--there's significant padding in the shoulders. It's also a shinier leather than expected. Sizing chart seems a bit inaccurate--I ordered a size larger than he normally wears in coats (which is a size larger than his regular clothing), but it was still too snug in places, lining or not. Overall, though, I'd say I got what I paid for, if you don't count the unusually high shipping charges.

I returned the wrong item and went with what I had which wasn't the right thing either but, it was better than what they sent.\\nI'm not happy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "1773  All in all I was extremely happy with the sturdy product.  It was off-black but it was a better testimony to its advertisement than the phony product I got at C-IN2.  I was surprised that I ordered a small and that's what I got.  It envelops my torso and shoulders and doesn't sag like other tank tops.  Pretty much if that's the size you ordered then you will get it.  I ordered the product on 23 February and got it on 27 February with regular shipping, so I was pretty psyched they surpassed their shipping obligations.  I know where to get my designer tanks now.

       "1774  I've worn rashgaurds for several years now. It's great to not worry about suncreen, and the dark colors help keep you warm if it is sunny but the water is cold.\\n\\nThis particular one has a nice, quality feel to it, though I think the sizes run a teeny bit small. You obviously want something that is close-fitting, but mine is a little too tight around the biceps (and I don't flatter myself that they are particularly large). I'm 5'8\" 150 lbs and got a size medium, but maybe a large would have been more comfortable.\\n\\nResponding to another reviewer, I think they're called rashgaurds because they protect your chest when paddling on a surfboard, but I'm not a surfer. I haven't ever gotten a rash by leaving it on wet, either, and it seems to dry pretty well to me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "1775  This is a good case made with nice materials. it offers a nice fit and buttons are easily usable. it comes with a clear screen protector and has a belt clip so you can carry it more comfortably. it is just a little bulky, but nothing to worry about if you plan to carry it in your belt, hand bag or hands. it could only fit big pockets, though. my only serious gripe is about the inner seams, they are very rough and could scratch the surface of your player. yes, Zen Vision:M's have very soft coating and this could leave marks. anyways, you really should consider getting a skin for your zen (Best Skins Ever) in any case.

       "1780  I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com, but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28, which makes it very unconfortable to wear. So becareful when ordering. Look at the manufacturer's sizing list (VERY SMALL LETTERS) to find the right size. By the way, I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer's sizing chart.

This would make a better toy for a little girl than an actual accessory                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1796  I have the same jacket in black but I bought this from elsewhere. What a rip off it is. It is made in china and the feather keeps on coming and on a given day I had to remove atleast 20- 25 of the feathers since they peek so much. I doubt how long this is going to last as eventually it will be a skinny jacket without the feathers.!!!

       "1797  As an emergency response volunteer, I need comfortable, sturdy pants with a lot of pockets. These fit the bill nicely. The pockets are a good size and easy to secure. The pants are lightweight and comfortable while being able to take some abuse, thanks to the reinforced knees and tough material. My only question is what the \"drawstrings\" on the legs are for. They don't actually gather the leg when you pull them. In fact, they don't seem to have any purpose at all. I am happy with the purchase and I am sure I will purchase the same thing again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "1811  If you are used to Levi's or the regular Wrangler jeans, here's some help in choosing a the right fit for this. This jean is the \"slim\" version of classic Cowboy Cut jean that Wrangler has been making since 1947. Among the Levi's jeans, the fit of this jeans is most similar to that of the Levi's 512,but it is cut slimmer in the seat. It doesn't have as much orange stitching as a Levi's, the back pockets sit higher. It has a zipper fly. The so-called \"rigid denim\" looks a lot like the \"shrink to fit\" rigid denim of the Levi's button fly 501 when new and will lose a lot of indigo dye on the first wash, but that's where the resemblance ends. The 501 shrinks about 10%, but the Wrangler shrinks less than 3%, because it is Sanforized. So, you should buy your correct size, erring on the side of slightly larger if you are right on the border.  \\n\\nCompared to the regular the Wrangler Cowboy Cut, the this slim Fit is quite a bit skimpier. The slim fit seat is smaller and the legs are pretty trim--it's more of a boy's cut. If you are really on the thin side, it may work for you, but many men will find it too constricting in the waist and seat. \\n\\nWranglers stonewash finishes are pretty mainstream compared to some of the more exotic things Levi's is doing now. These definitely are not so-called \"destructed\" jeans. You won't find whiskering or abrasion the way you will on the stonewash Levi's. \\n\\nOverall, these are very solid well-made jeans that offer a nice alternative to the more popular Levi's models.

       "1816  This sweater runs large the arms go over my knuckles & it's long in the waist. I bought this sweater in a large which is what the size chart indicated for me.( I'm 5'6 & wear a 10 or 12.)  It shedded alot. I was leaving fuzzies everywhere plus I wore this with a tan skirt & I had quite a bit of color transfer. Even though it was inexpensive I do not feel it's worth the price                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1818  Talk about being the envy at the beach or pool. I received my bag and tore into the box. I was so excited. The bag was beautiful. Being a Prada expert this is a true Prada Bag.

       "1820  i think the item is real good. but i was disappointed when the screen did not have a screen protector..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1836  It's rare to find a backpack that looks good on college women that has the size and durability to match.  This bag does it!  I purchased it in turquoise and it is gorgeous.  There are plenty of pockets and ways to organize--the side water bottle pockets are waterproofed zippered (as most of the pockets are) and will be useful for items other than bottles.  Although it seemed small when I opened it, as soon as I began loading it, it quickly expanded to meet my demands!  I purchased this to study abroad with in Spain and don't feel as though I'll be disappointed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1838  I knew my daughter found her dress when I heard the squeals of delight. Living in a small town our choices are limited, so I turned to Amazon.com for my daughters graduation dress. The picture shows a very pretty dress, but when I got it this turned out to be a truly stunning dress. The fit was perfect, PacificPlex's sizes are right on, and their sizing chart really helped so check that out before you buy. The dress in very well made and included straps that could be sewn on should one choose too. My daughter felt like a princess and my friend ordered the burgundy version for her daughters graduation. This dress is beautiful in both colors. We are very pleased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "1842  This swim jock is a great all around jock.  Very durable and very comfortable pouch and straps.  Mine has taken a beating, and has not fallen apart like other jocks I own.  The swim style is cut very low in front, with a fairly small pouch.  Not only is it great for working out under your workout pants or shorts, it actually turns out to be a very sexy pair of underwear for everyday or play.  The low rise cut pairs very well with low rise jeans, not to mention the barely there skimpy factor.  Heat it up a little and try this jock under your low cut jeans.....looks and feels hot!  If you're looking for a jock with less coverage and a lower waistband or just a comfortable sexy pair of underwear, this jock is a great buy for the price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1843  I agree that this is a good bra - even for larger sizes.  I am a 36DD and I wore my first one out from sheer overuse - I kept washing it and wearing it the next day. I loved it and I love the way it looked under my clothes.  The one drag is that I ripped the lacy part - and from reviews on herrom.com that seems to be pretty common.  Otherwise I would reccommend it to others like me - large bust and a regular or small chest.  Plus, the racer back gives women with a large bust a break from the strap marks from regular bras                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1844  Be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards.  I bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards, my ID and some cash.  Hence, there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet.  From the picture, it looks as though the business card side is just a slot. Whereas, in reality, it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders).  Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space), the leather itself is very low quality, and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it.  Furthermore, on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China.  I mean, China is great and all but if you're on a date and you say \"Hey, let me pay for this,\" and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China, well, you are pretty much a schmuck (I cut mine out with a pair of scissors, but there are still some remnants).  So if you like being low class, by all means, buy this wallet.  I personally don't care about my wallet very much so I am keeping it and going to use it, but I almost returned it.  It is most definitely a solid 2 stars.  Hope this helps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "1845  I'm so glad I got these. It solved my issues with now too-tight bands and I can wear my pre-pregnancy bras without complaining that I can't breathe. I do have a couple of 3-hook bras that don't conform to the sizes available but since they give you the measurement of the band, I was able to get extenders for the bras that fall within the range that they offer. I'm very happy with those. I even ordered a couple more in different colors. The items arrived within the shipping estimate they gave, despite the holidays. And if they offer free shipping for other products in the future, I will certainly buy more things from this vendor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1846  These are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff Levi's. My cutoffs are so faded, so frayed, so, well you know. So when I peal them off to reveal this Butterfly Lace up Panty (in Black with the pick laces on the back) it's like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl. We only had two colors at our lingerie party, white and the black and pink models, but I can imagine all the colors would be nice too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "1850  Most umbrellas handle a light rain well, but leave you with wet pants during heavy rains.  This umbrella is essential equipment for keeping you dry during downpours.  I use it for the walking part of my commute through Washington, DC thunderstorms and it performs like a champ.  It's also big enough to cover two, allowing you to share your dry haven with a child, spouse, or co-worker.  The auto-close is great for letting you close the umbrella in a heavy rain from the shelter of your car or cab.  An auto open/close umbrella this size is very hard to find...in fact this is the only one I know of.  Quality is good...I've had one for four years that travels with me regularly on my commute.  Price at Amazon is great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "889   be huge fan of under Armour workout apparel and in addition to own several of these Tech shirt also own several each of the Loose Gear shirt and the Heat Gear compression shirt have write review on those as well the Tech shirt feel really good on your skin like your favorite most comfortable old cotton shirt it look just like cotton and have matte finish it be not shiny silky like the Loose Gear shirt or Heat Gear compression shirt it be very soft comfortable and lightweight and love this shirt both for work out and casual wear the shirt run true to size buy your regular shirt size and it will fit really well and be the roomy cut of the Under Armour shirt absolutely love the raglan sleeve on the tech tee of the feature that make they so comfortable and give they little bit of unique look the tech tee have small amount of lycra like fabric in with the polyester microfiber which give it quite bit of stretch like this because the shirt do not bind if you be do something that really require you to reach or stretch certain weight exercise aerobics yoga etc the shirt work the way it be suppose to and wick moisture from your skin for rapid evaporation the tech tee be available in numerous color have of they and in spite of the fact that the fabric be thin and lightweight the shirt be very opaque the shirt have nice cut and look great over jean or short in addition to the gym often wear they out and around or when work in the yard they be super comfortable wear as an undershirt too but be probably little costly for that like all the Under Armour shirt they have self material neck band but it fit just right and say in place even if you get sweaty it do not sag like the cotton one while have complaint about the tech tee be aware that it be under Armour budget product if there be such thing the material do start to pill after few washing this affect appearance slightly but not performance or fit although have not wear out any of my under Armour shirt yet be go to venture that the tech shirt will not be quite as durable as their signature Loose Gear shirt and Heat Gear compression shirt nor do it perform quite as well on the other hand it it be about cheap so as with anything else you get what you pay for when stack up against UA other shirt would say the tech tee be for you if you like the look and feel of soft cotton shirt but want the wicking and performance of microfiber shirt you do not care for the shiny silky more synthetic look and feel of the Loose Gear shirt or the tightness of the Heatgear compression shirt you want shirt that be little roomy you want shirt with stretch in it you want to save little but still wear an authentic UA logo shirt   \n",

       "1187  well after use my Creative Zen naked with no covering at all with the other popular leather cover and with this sillicon cover package can honestly say that consider the price and what be include in this package this be by far the good route to go when pick case for your own Zen the other main case the leather look nice but for around expect little more functionality this cover be few dollar cheaper and for that would only expect cover as be include with the leather but when you take into account the screen protector that be include and which cost by itself from other place the stand on the back which be grant mildly weak but look at what it be hold up if you watch your share of video and movie on your Zen as do the back stand come in very handy and the other thing would expect it to be more so do not let the cheap price deter you from get this as it almost do think that it be poor quality the sillicon tend to attract dust and lint but it wipe or blow away easily and be really the only thing that come close to downside get this case you will not regret it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
